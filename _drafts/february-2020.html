- cleaned bird boxes
- lots of dog walks
- set up camera by compost and found out the flying squirrels come every night!
- put out some big moose bones, Tammi found a way on many walks to sneak off to the meat!
- the squirrels are very peppy and tryingt to impress each other, leads to a lot of squirrel yelling and ants in pants dogs
- we started buying groceries again... and more than we originally planned as we realized that with the potential arrival of covid-19 more widely in Canada, we had just eaten through our food supplies!
