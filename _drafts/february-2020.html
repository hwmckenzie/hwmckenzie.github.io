<p>February. The shortest of all months (even with the bonus day this year), but coming at the darkest and coldest time of the year. Due to its location in the heart of winter, February has inspired such quotes as</p><p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">February is a suitable month for dying. Everything around is dead, the trees black and frozen so that the appearance of green shoots two months hence seems preposterous, the ground hard and cold, the snow dirty, the winter hateful, hanging on too long.<br>
-  Anna Quindlen, One True Thing</blockquote>

<p>Unlike last year when we escaped on our honeymoon to summer in New Zealand, we spent this February at the property. We enjoyed many wonderful dog walks. I (Hannah) have been working from home most days, which gives me the opportunity to take the dogs for a second walk in the afternoon during the time I would otherwise be commuting home from the office. A good trade-off! The dogs and I enjoyed some truly breathtaking evening walks and I felt very grateful to be able to savour these extra daylight hours by snowshoe. Chris and I also enjoyed our daily morning dog walks. Thanks to these walks, the following quote more accurately captured Februrary for us this year.</p>
  
<blockquote class="blockquote">Keep your faith in beautiful things;<br>
in the sun when it is hidden,<br>
in the Spring when it is gone.<br>
-  Roy R. Gibson</blockquote>

<p>As the winter progresses, our compost bin is getting full of frozen food scraps from the Red Brick cafe, and on warmer afternoons it is starting to smell a little. I suppose some olfatory foreshadowing of what awaits us once spring does arrive! So, we decided to set up a trail camera to see if anyone was visting it at night. To our surprise, the visitors were flying squirrels! And boy did they visit a lot! Nice to know someone is benefiting from our composting efforts!</p>

<p>The squirrels weren't the only animals enjoying a feast in February. We, or more accurately the dogs, were gifted some moose meat and bones from on of our friends on the fire department. Having more than we could feed the dogs, we set out a few bones around our property in the hopes of catching some foxes or coyotes on our trail cameras. It turns out that the magpies are first on scene, and they don't leave much for second comers! However, this did mean that Tammi disappeared like clockwork on every walk to go to "the meat", so we captured her on camera a few times!

<p>Later in the month, likely in anticipation of spring, there was an uptick in squirrel activity. This led to a loud work environment for Chris in his cabin-office as the squirrels engaged in their socializations in the nearby trees, and also to highly vigilant dogs who felt the need to keep an eye on (and inform us of!) all squirrel activities.</p>

<p>We also started buying groceries again this month, and at a higher rate than originally planned due to the arrival of COVID-19. It turns out that our timing of eating through our food stores may not have been ideal! Not wanting to be caught without some stores in the case of any social distancing that might occur in the near future, we did a bit of stocking up on beans and rice, as well as frozen fruit and vegetables. So, while the risk of COVID-19 is still on the horizon, we have solidly banished scurvy back to the 1800s!</p>

<p>At the end of the month Hannah noticed some chickadees investigating the bird boxes. In respose to demand, we went around and cleaned out the boxes from last year and added a few inches of woodchips to entice any chickadees. Sadly we found several dead tree swallows, as we did last year. Though, this year they were confined to two boxes of the same design. Originally designed for bluebirds, there are deeper boxes and seem to be a bad idea for tree swallows. So, we have taken them down and will make some modifications for this season. We also found that most boxes were stuffed full of sticks, a sure sign of house wren activity. Hopefully a bit of research will reveal what can be done to encourage some tennants other than wrens.</p>

<h5>February's property indicator(s)</h5>

<p>The indicator for February is 721.1 kWh. Our house, the office, and plugging in our vehicles used this many kilowatt hours this month.
