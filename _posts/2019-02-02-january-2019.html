<h2 class="section-heading">January 1st</h2>

<p>Chris and I started our year at The Cabin (not to be confused with The Property!). We enjoyed a very tasty and elaborate fondu (broth, oil, AND cheese), much champagne, and decadent cheesecake (with 3 choices of topping!), all courtesy of Marlene (food) and Ron (bubbles). Heather and her new dog Ace were there too and we enjoyed many good dog walks. Very good times had by all, although I think we were all asleep or at least in bed when the New Year officially arrived. On our way home on New Year’s Day we saw Heather and Sandy off with a tasty breakfast in Spruce Grove as they started their drive north to Whitehorse.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">January 4th</h2>

<p>Today we welcomed a new four-footed furry family member: Revi! Although Revi’s family loved her, it just wasn’t working out. Luckily Leanne knew we had an opening since we said goodbye to Spike a few years ago. I know, if you have 3 dogs, do you really have an opening?! Well, we did for Revi. She seems to be a very sweet dog who loves people, though I’m sure she will reveal some sneaky and prankster ways once she gets acclimatized.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The rest of January</h2>

<p>Hmmm, it seems the rest of January has flown by and suddenly it is gone. So I will just try to summarize the main points.</p>

<p>Revi has settled in well. Her and Seuss spent the first few days constantly playing, which was very cute, but the humans finally had to separate them so everyone could take a break and get on with other things. Revi is doing well on our walks and is getting better at coming back when called… mostly!</p>

<p>Our kitchen got an upgrade with a new tap. Despite much effort by Chris, our original tap insisted on leaking unless tightened frequently. After attempting to live with this quirk for a while (I mean, no one is perfect, right?), we decided it was time to bite the bullet. The new model looks quite similar, with the distinctive difference being that water only comes out where one expects it to!</p>

<p>Tammi also got an upgrade to her sleeping arrangements this month. She is now allowed on the couch! She is very pleased with this situation as it allows her to escape the antics of the other dogs.</p>

<p>After some procrastination, both Sadie and I went to the dentist this month, so our pearly whites are indeed (mostly) white. No cavities or extractions needed for dog or human, so overall a relatively painless experience. We are both determined to strive for better oral hygiene (or at least, I am determined to strive for both of us)!</p>

<p>We continue to enjoy our daily walks in the Birth Coulee conservation area next to our house, and have gotten some neat wildlife views from our trail cameras. This one even comes with audio (thanks to Chris for figuring out how to make that work with our blog!).</p>

<p>Chris, Seuss and I also ventured a little further afield to check out the Morrison conservation area. Seuss and I were heading there to look for wild boar scat after some boar were spotted during an aerial survey nearby. Chris decided he would like to join, and I was very grateful.  It is always nice to have a strong, handsome field assistant who is happy to carry your backpack, while you shuffle along on snowshoes in a semi-panicked state trying to keep your highly energetic search dog in sight! We made two visits and saw lots of sign of deer and moose, but no boar. There are still two more quadrants to search, but due to the large amount of snow, and our imminent trip to New Zealand, I expect they will have to wait until spring. I suspect the boar are further south, enjoying leftover crops in farmers’ fields anyway!</p>

<p>January ended with a blizzard and February is looking very wintery so far. Nice to be all cosy in our cabin.</p>
