<p>Kia Ora!</p>

<p>At least that is what Chris and I will be saying early on Friday morning when we step off the plane in New Zealand. As many readers know, this is our honeymoon to celebrate getting married in September. Here in our cosy cabin, we are currently watching the temperature plummet and the snow fall… and happily counting down the days to our departure, which at the moment only requires one hand :)</p>

<p>We will be exploring New Zealand for three weeks. To preview what you might read about here, our plans include: canyoning (think repelling, jumping, and sliding down waterfalls), biking along an old railway line, kayaking at night, an overnight walk (or as Kiwis might say, “tramp”?) along beaches, going on a boat that delivers mail to remote communities, taking a train along the northeast coast of the south island, lots of sightseeing, and meeting a couple who work with detection dogs to find kiwis (… the birds, not the fruits!).</p>

<p>We will post about our adventures here and you are invited to follow along if you like. Certainly many readers were involved in making it possible for us to take this trip, so we want to share it with you… though maybe not ALL the details… it is our honeymoon after all ;)</p>
