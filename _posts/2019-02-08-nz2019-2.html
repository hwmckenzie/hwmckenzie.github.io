<b><i>February 8</i></b>

<p>Well, we lost a day but gained about 53 degrees in temperature, which seems like an acceptable trade to me!</p>

<p>Not too much to report from our first day in the country. The flight was as you would expect: Long. However, it went by, and now we are here! We picked up our car and Chris got us to our Airbnb, all while remaining on the correct side of the road, which I rank as no easy feat. Our Airbnb is very neat and a wonderful place to arrive to after an ocean crossing, it even came with the makings for a tasty breakfast.</p>

<p>After showers and naps, we headed out to explore on foot, completing the loop shown below.</p>

<p>We walked along “on-trend” Ponsonby road, which was full of places to eat and drink. However, since a person can only eat and drink so much (without starting to feel like a glutton at least!), we walked to the foot of the Auckland harbour bridge, where one could bungee jump off the bridge if one so desired... which this particular one did not!</p>

<p>We returned home, which by this point had amounted to quite a few steps, and I should note that Auckland is not a flat place! After some recovery, we went out in search of something to bring home for dinner and found “Farro”, which must be New Zealand’s version of Sunterra. Dinner in hand, we returned home, watched the first half of the movie "Up" and barely got the murphy bed down in time to collapse into it. Tomorrow we leave Auckland for the first leg of our trip which involves a driving loop on the North island.</p>
