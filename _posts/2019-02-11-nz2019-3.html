<p>A little behind with the blog-writing. We're currently sitting outside at the Flatwhite Cafe on Waihi beach, watching waves and drinking coffee.</p>

<p>On our second day in New Zealand we left our Auckland Airbnb to head to Thames. This was exciting as it was my first properly rested drive in New Zealand. Left handed driving can make for some anxious times, but so far so good. We've found it the most difficult crossing the street as pedestrians actually - often looking the wrong way at the wrong time, or thinking we've escaped the danger of oncoming traffic when we haven't.</p>

<p>We stopped just outside of Auckland at the Clevedon Co-op for coffee and marvelled at the price of peaches ($3 / peach). Clevedon seemed like a legitimate farming community, judging by the topics of conversation and the footwear.</p>

<p>Our next targetted destination was the Miranda Shorebird Centre where we were hoping to see some unique brids. On the way we stopped at a small sampling of beaches; not really lay-in-the-sand type beaches, but nice nonetheless. Being a Saturday (or I assume because) there were lots of families out fishing and wading around in water.</p>

<p>Our arrival at the Bird sanctuary was poorly timed, as the tide had gone out far enough that the birds couldn't easily be seen any more. We opted to drive to the bird "blind" rather than do the hour long hike. Luckily at the bird blind was a woman with what essentially looked like a telescope, and she was pointing out various birds and telling us how land reclaimation along their migration path was leading to considerable drops in population. A picture I managed to get through her telescope:</p>

<p>We were pleased/displeased to discover that there are Canadian Geese in New Zealand! Rotten Europeans brought them over for something to hunt, and turned out the geese liked the place. Related interesting fact - the largest wild predator in New Zealand is the possum, which was also introduced.</p>

<p>Our bed and breakfast in Thames was in an old bar (1915?) that was refitted to be a B&B. So far no places we've been have had air conditioning, and this place was where I was missing it the most. Having said that, there were several very nice outdoor areas we could lounge in there.</p>

<p>We walked along the ocean on a trail for an hour or so, then cut back into town for the walk back to look for food. We settled on "Mad Burger" which was exceptionally good. Prices in New Zealand are weird - we got delicious fries wrapped in paper about the size of a 3-ring binder for $3NZD (which is worth less than CAD), but a single peach is $3 and a 12 pack of Dr. Pepper is $16.</p>

<p>The next morning we got up early for a walk, then got ready to go on our canyon adventure. We're still waiting to get the pictures from that, so there should be more on that soon. The gist of it is that it was a full day of hiking up a mountain and then repelling/jumping/zip-lining/abseiling down the canyon. All of this was in a wetsuit; I was full-body pruney by the time I was able to peel out of it. We had lunch half-way down, and burgers at the end. It was a great time.</p>

<p>We got back to our B&B, wandered the town failing to find ice cream, then called it a day!</p>
