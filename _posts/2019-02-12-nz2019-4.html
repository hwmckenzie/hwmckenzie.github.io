<h5>February 11</h5>

<p>After breakfast we said goodbye to Thames and headed to Paeroa to pick up our bikes and join up with the Hairaki Rail Trail, an old railway turned bike trail. The couple running the info centre were so friendly and even offered to come back after hours to let us return our bikes late! We are learning that this is very typical Kiwi hospitality. We pedalled out of Paeroa to see what we could see.</p>

<p>The trail was beautiful and weaved through cow and sheep pastures and in and out of trees. After not too long we arrived at a 1km long tunnel. You could just see the light at the other end and we pedalled towards it, enjoying being under the cool rock. Soon after we arrived at the Victoria Battery, our first encounter with the Waihi gold mining era (which is still ongoing). We also dismounted here to catch the Goldfields train from Waikino to Waihi.</p>

<p>Once in Waihi we found our way to the Gold Discovery Centre and took in the exhibits and then walked across the street to see the open pit mine. Operations are currently on hold pending permits, but they are still mining there today.</p>

<p>Before biking back to Paeroa to retrieve our car, we went to introduce ourselves to Caron, our Airbnb host. She lives on a farm just at the edge of Waihi, and luckily for us, right on the Ohinemiri river. After a quick dip we were ready to tackle the return ride. We stopped at Owharoa falls and started the Windows walk, a really neat hike through the mountain with windows in the rock looking down on the Waitawheta river. By this point it was getting perilously tight for us to continue the walk and make it back to drop off our bikes, even with the extra time... luckily common sense intervened (in the form of Chris!) and we decided to return the next day to finish the walk. We made it back, butts a little sore and very hungry, but happy. After pizza, we pointed our car in the direction of our Airbnb... only to realize that the road through the gorge we needed to take, the same one we had biked beside all day, was closed! No problem the lady told us, just take the detour. After consulting google, we ascertained that the “detour” was in fact  over an hour through the Coromandel forest, which we soon learned meant it was very curvy. Based on the signs for scenic lookouts we saw, I think it is a route that you would take as a scenic tour... during the day! When we told Caron we ended up driving it in the dark we all laughed until I thought she might fall over!</p> 

<p>Needless to say we fell into bed in our little rustic cabin knowing that we squeezed every minute out of today!</p>
