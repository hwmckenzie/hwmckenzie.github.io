<h5>February 12</h5>

<p>We woke up at our Waihi rustic cabin, better able to explore our surroundings. The day before we had taken a detour from our bike trip in order to check in, as we were struggling to come up with a reasonably accurate time for when we'd be able to get there by car. After meeting our host we did a quick dip in the river, but then had to be on our way. Our surroundings were definitely rustic.</p>

<p>As we were leaving in the morning we told our host, Caron, that we had swiped most the fruit from our kitchen. She said she could give us even more and lead us through a part of her yard we hadn't seen yet. We were able to pick big bunches of grapes off the vine, picked some apples that the cows weren't tall enough to eat when they escaped a few days earlier, and found some pears as well, which she thought might be ready in a few days (still waiting). Not a bad haul, although the grapes proved too plentiful. A couple days later (today) while eating on a beach we didn't do anything to stop a gang of mallard ducks from eating all the grapes straight out of the Tupperware.</p>

<p>The prior day we had checked out the "Window walk" but ran out of time, so this was now on the agenda for the day. We also wanted to swim in the ocean at a place called Bowentown. Our morning Airbnb was dead in the middle of these two places. So we went to Bowentown for our morning coffee (east), then went and did the Window walk (west), then went back to Bowentown to swim (east).</p>

<p>The Window Walk was really neat, and as far as I know, it consisted of an old mining tunnel with "windows" knocked out of the side where you could look out at the scenery.</p>

<p>Cooler still (literally and figuratively) were the mining tunnels that didn't have any windows, where one needed a flashlight to see anything. Luckily I had brought my favourite flashlight. At the end of one tunnel I turned it off, and it was absolutely black. Hannah was uninterested in seeing if waiting for our eyes to adjust would allow us to see any outside light.</p>

<p>Swimming in Bowentown was nice. The "town" in Bowentown seems appropriate, as there wasn't much else going on there. Hannah and I took a swim and watched the dogs chasing sticks and digging holes. I did my best to make eyes at some of the dogs, but none of them came to visit. After a lap of the beach to warm up again we headed off.</p>

<p>Our next Airbnb was exceptionally nice and exceptionally small. I might save more on that for the next post. As usual, we didn't have much time to enjoy, as shortly after unloading our stuff we went off to go on our glow worm kayaking tour.</p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="https://hwmckenzie.github.io/img/posts/nz2019/glow-van.jpg" alt="">

<p>It was a bit of a rough start, as there were lots of us crammed into a van towing kayaks, which was hot, and navigated some very curvy and steep roads. The van trip was soon forgotten once they pulled out the cheese, crackers, chips, dip, and wine.</p>

<p>After some food, kayaking pairs were formed, drivers were chosen, and we headed up stream (Even though this was a lake). Hannah was the driver (in the back), so things were pretty easy for me.</p>

<p>Soon it was dark enough that pictures weren't really possible. We all bunched up at a power station upstream, linked up kayaks in groups of 3, and then a guide towed is into a canyon. It was incredibly dark, but hidden in the trees initially, and soon in full view, were hundreds of little green glowing lights. We just floated there while the guides told us about glow worms. Turns out they're actually New Zealand fruit fly larve (maggots), which were named "glow worms" by the tourism industry. These maggots hang a strand of ... something sticky, then use their glow to attract bugs. When they catch a bug they reel it in, drill a hole in its head, and suck out the insides.</p>
