<b><i>February 13</i></b>

<p>We woke up this morning to a wonderful view of our own personal valley, enjoyed from an airy tiny house-pod.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of our host, we headed off to walk around “The Mount”, or Mount Maunganui, an extinct volcanic cone on a peninsula in the Tauranga harbour. It also features prominently in local Maori mythology. As usual, it was a already quite hot as we walked around the base of the mount. The trail went right along the water and we had some great views of the harbour and also right out to the South Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>We even got to watch a big seal floating around in a calm area doing barrel rolls and waving his (her?!) flippers. I can’t be sure, but I think it was just enjoying the water. When we had almost fully circled the base is when things got serious as we started up to the summit. The trail went mostly up and there were only a few shady spots, in which we took breaks and I sucked wind! Lea, if you are reading this, it reminded me very much of our hike in Hawaii up that switchback track, when we later met the pig hunters! If I ever felt my resolve to continue waver, it was renewed by seeing the age of some of the people who were hiking with us. I hope I can be hiking up mounts like this when I am their age! I felt quite accomplished when we reached the top and we got to enjoy some breeze and great views.</p>

<p>The descent was much quicker and soon we were standing on a very wavy beach.</p>

<p>We went “swimming” to cool off, which consisted mainly of standing on a steep sand slope which appeared to be metres from the water, only to have big waves arrrive and crash on us! Chris was much braver than I. I felt like a small bird gingerly venturing forward in the wake of a retreating wave, only to rush back as the next approached. After a bit of that, we took an outdoor shower (which I found to be by far more refreshing than trying to cool off in the surf, and afforded the same views!) and went in search of food. Our energy restored, we said goodbye to the Bay of Plenty and headed off to Rotorua, our home for the evening.</p>

Upon our arrival we were greeted by Shawnee and Zak, the two resident Austrailian cattle dogs. Shawnee was quite old, mostly blind, and disabled after suffering an embolism in her youth. She was a little cranky at first with us. But once she taught us where to scratch her we became fast friends and she hung out with us the whole time we were there, lying under the Rpod camper we were sleeping in.

Since I am on this trip, this was of course not the end of our day :). After a quick break we headed out to see the Redwoods Tree walk, a neat installation of suspension bridges in a group of redwood trees, adorned with lanterns and lights at night. Our camper was quite close, so we were able to walk there through an experimental forest area, which was quite cool. The treewalk was popular, so we had to wait in line and it was quite busy up in the trees.

<p>The walk was very beatiful, although I also enjoyed our own private walk home in the dark through the forest by the light of Chris’s phone.</p>

<p>By this time our camper had cooled down and we were soon asleep after a very full day.</p>
