<h5>February 14 & 15</h5>

<p>Happy Valentine’s Day! We decided it was time to slow down a little, for real. We started the day by doing some laundry, hanging out with the resident dogs Shawnee and Zak, and watching our host Tove feed some baby sparrows baby bird formula with a suringe. They were rescued by her husband the day before from his worksite... he must be a true animal lover to rescue sparrows! Once our laundry was merrily drying on the line (in seconds no doubt based on the temperature!) we headed out to the Government Garden Cafe for our daily coffee. It turns out coffee is a bit of a national passion for Kiwis, which we have no problem joining! This morning I added a muffin, which could be a dangerous addition to the daily routine. Once caffeinated we took a walk around the gardens, the waterfront, and back along “Eat Street”, which looks like it would be quite the happening place when night falls.</p>

<p>At this point our vacation meandering was rudely interrupted as we realized our parking metre had run out! Luckily we arrived before the parking police and left the scene before any tickets could be issued.</p>

<p>In serious need of some cooling off we drove to nearby Blue lake. This was the first time we had any trouble buying something. Through poor planning we had limited cash with us, and the food truck only accepted cash or EFTPOS, a system which our plastic didn’t talk to. Even with the nice lady at the RV park trying to help us out by getting us cash back through a system meant to provide change for the laundry (which also only spoke EFTPOS), we were left with only enough spare change to get french fries. Luckily the food truck guy was very nice and gave us extra fries. This sustained us, so we took a swim along the shore. So refreshing! We worked our way towards some sort of event at the far end of the lake which turned out to be a “bomb comp”. Kiwis are crazy for jumping into the water from great heights! They were just getting set up, but already people of all ages were climbing up scaffolding to varying heights and completing practice “bombs” into the water.</p>

<p>We returned to our Rpod camper and brought in the laundry before heading out for “date night” at the Skyline. This is a great place where you take a gondola ride up to an entertainment park of sorts. Following suggestions from Amy and Brad, we bought a pack of luge rides and set about careening down the tracks from “scenic” to “advanced”. What a great time! Definitely a good stop.</p>

<p>The next morning on our way out of Rotorua we visited the Wai-o-taupo Thermal Wonderland, an active geothermal area. The visit started with the eruption of the Lady Knox geyser which, thanks to the addition of environmentally friendly detergent by a helpful park interpreter, erupts daily at 10:15 each morning.</p>

<p>Though the geyser was impressive, knowing the eruption was human initiated took away from it a bit. Left to its own devices it would erupt every 2-3 days. We then followed the trail to see bubbling mud pools (which sadly were pretty dry due to the lack of rain here), a bright green lake, various coloured rocks and steaming vents and a big steaming lake with a multi-coloured shore.</p>

<p>Quite neat to think about all of earth’s internal activity being so close to the surface, but very stinky. We suspect that house prices in Rotarua depend partly on smelly-ness! Having experienced enough smell and heat (and other tourists!), we hit the road towards Lake Taupo and Tongariro National Park.</p>
