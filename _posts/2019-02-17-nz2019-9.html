<h5>February 17</h5>

<p>We woke up this morning in our own little private space overlooking Wellington.</p>

<p>We headed into the main house to enjoy breakfast provided by our hosts Ross and Mark, complete with croissants baked that morning! Many of our Airbnb hosts provide some sort of breakfast, which we weren’t expecting, but is sure a nice touch. Thus sustained, we began the descent down to Aro street, where we enjoyed a relaxing coffee while reading. Each morning as we do this, I ask myself how I can incorporate this routine into my “real” life back home. I haven’t given up hope entirely, but I suspect it might only happen when I retire :)</p>

<p>Our plan today was to visit Zealandia, an urban ecosanctuary within Wellington. This is a very neat place. It is a 225 hectare area, right in the city that has been set aside for conservation, with the goal of restoring the ecosystem to pre-human New Zealand, as much as possible, over the next 500 years. This involved designing and erecting a fence to exclude predators (cats, possums, stoats, and rats) and then undertaking ongoing intensive predator control within the fence. I got quite excited as we had to go through a double gate and have our bags searched upon entry to ensure we weren’t inadvertantly carrying any invasive species! They have had quite a lot of success in inceasing bird populations through predator removal, and they have reintroduced 18 species of native wildlife into the park, including 6 species which were previously absent from the NZ mainland for over 100 years! Sadly, many species known to be present in pre-human NZ, most notably the moa, a large flightless bird much taller than a person, became extinct quickly following colonization. However, with our guided tour we got to take a boat up the man-made lake to the first dam, and see the only two Takahe birds living in Zealandia, and their new baby! Takahe are large flightless birds. They were once thought to be extinct and remain critcally endangered, so seeing a young one was pretty heartening.</p>

<p>After the Takahe we saw some tuatara, which is a small lizard-like species that was a contemporary of the dinosaurs, and were also lucky enough to see two parrot species, the kaka and the smaller kakariki.</p>

<p>We also met several New Zealand robins, which look much different than ours. Our guide showed us how if you scrape the leaf litter off the ground while the robin is watching, it will then fly down to see if you revealed any insects. The preserve had also set up some “weta hotels” (or dead stumps with doors on one side you could open to view the tree wetas that had taken up residence inside). These are slightly less charismatic residents of Zealandia which look like large, predatory grasshoppers... or characters from a scifi movie! Though we had not seen them before, we had already been in close proximity to the tree wetas’ cousin, the cave weta, when we did our glow worm kayaing, as wetas are the main predators of glow worms.</p>

<p>Overall Zealandia was a great stop. Although we didn’t get to see kiwi (as they are nocturnal), we did chat with one of the interpreters about them, and she also told us how after they found a stoat inside the fence and removed it, they had the Department of Conservation dogs search the park to ensure there were’t any more! Conservation detection dogs are widely used in New Zealand, which got me pretty excited!</p>

<p>We descended from Zealandia to the Wellington harbour via the cable car, after first visiting the cable car museum. It was quite a feat of engineering when it was first built, and taking the cable car up to the hills from the city was quite the outing in those times!</p>

<p>Arriving back at the harbour to find the Te Papa museum closed (sigh), we walked along the water, and enjoyed some dinner and drinks. Cider is currently our drink of choice as it is very refreshing in the heat which continues here. Wellington appears to be a very “awake” city as compared to others we have been in and has quite a bit of nightlife (despite being a “government” town!).</p>

<p>On our harbour walk we also observed another expression of Kiwis’ passion for doing “bombs” into water. There was a special area of the waterfront set aside for jumping in, with platforms built for the purpose, and people jumping and cheering each other on!</p>

<p>After a very busy day, much walking, and many steps climbed, we returned to our rooftop space to enjoy a good nights sleep so as to be ready bright and early for our ferry trip to the South Island the next day.</p>
