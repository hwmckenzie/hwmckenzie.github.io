<h5>February 18</h5>

<p>A short post today, but a significant one to mark our departure from the North island and arrival on the South Island.</p>

<p>We arose early to catch the ferry which took us across Cook Strait and into Queen Charlotte sound. Lucky for me, the seas were classified as “light”, and in fact the trip was very smooth. We had a good view of Wellington as we left, and coming into the sound was neat as it is not very wide and the vegetation goes right down to the shore. It reminded me quite a lot of the crossing from Vancouver to Victoria, and was about the same length of trip.</p>

<p>Once in Picton we hopped on a bus for Nelson which would be our home base for walking the coastal track in Abel Tasman National Park. After our walk we had a whole day in Nelson so we’ll describe the town more in that post. Suffice to say, we arrived at our Airbnb and met our host Julie. In this case we had a room in Julie’s house and were sharing the bathroom. As Julie was on the older side and very friendly, it sort of felt like we were staying with our grandmother. Off to sleep thinking of what we would see on our hike.</p>
