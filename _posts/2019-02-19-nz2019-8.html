<b><i>February 15 continued and February 16</i></b>

<p>Hannah was a bit more excited about the Wai-o-taupo Thermal Wonderland than I was. For the most part, one sulphurous-smelling pit of hot steam looks just like every other (to me, at least). After walking around for the morning we were eager to cool off, and kayaking on a lake was the plan. We headed to Lake Taupo, and Acacia Bay in particular.</p>

<p>At Acacia Bay we had a bit of a picnic with the various items of food laying around the rental car. Sitting in the grass it was quickly apparent the local ducks had become accustomed to a certain level of feeding. A gang of Mallard ducks, probably numbering a little under 10, closed in on our picnic spot from 3 directions. Hannah remained resolute in not feeding them, but I snuck some bread crust to the lone duck cozying up to my elbow. The ducks soon found their in, however, in the form of our well-travelled grapes. Sitting in an open tupperware container in front of us, neither Hannah nor I made any moves to prevent the first bold duck from trying his luck. This duck made off with one grape. The second duck, maybe two grapes. The third duck chowed down to such an extent I thought it wise to search for whether or not ducks ought to be eating so many grapes (they're fine). With no point reversing course now, I took a bunch out for the ducks behind us to pick through. And that's the story of how we finally made it through our home-grown New Zealand grapes.</p>

<p>After eating we spent $40 for an hour with two kayaks. Not enough time to go see the falls (up north on the lake), or Maori stone carvings (south), but it did let us get on the water. We went two bays over and found a rock we could get out on and swim from.</p>

<p>While out treading water a group of swans (we're guessing, as we were told Canadian geese are the only geese in New Zealand) started heading towards us. They ended up between us an our kayaks, but seemed happy to get out of the way when we tried to get back on our rock. We dried off, headed back to our car, and set out for our next Airbnb.</p>

<p>Ohakune was the place of our next Airbnb, and in hindsight, I think this was my favourite one. Ohakune, if I were to guess, is like a ski resort town. It being summer here, there wasn't much going on. Our Airbnb - and hosts - were great. The length of their driveway rivals ours, but theirs has large trees overhanging it.</p>

<p>Coming in, on the right was a large fenced field with sheep, with open - but unpopulated - fields ahead and to the left. In the distance were mountains. We had our own little suite attached to the main house, with all the things one might want, except for a kitchen sink, which meant we didn't have to do our own dishes! There was also a stream beside the house.</p>

<p>Our hosts had a dog named Diesel - a 5 year old black lab. He was as friendly as you'd expect a lab to be, and it didn't take long before I had him racing around the grass and jumping around with me. One of Diesel's tricks was jumping over their ~5 foot fence, but he didn't just do it for show, as in the morning when we were looking for him he was called, and he appeared out of the trees by just leaping over the fence and running over.</p>

<p>We left wishing we could have spent more time, but we were scheduled for Wellington that day (Feb. 16th). Also sadly, this was the day we had to give up our rental car. Our Toyota Yaris had kept our phones charged, our bodies cool, and done well in keeping us affixed to the sharply turning New Zealand roads. Also, happily, it had a credit on the toll road account associated with its plate - free toll roads! It was busses and Ubers from this point forward.</p>

<p>The number of hills in Wellington was striking. Google Maps directed us through a labyrinth of hidden staircases to get us to where we were going while on foot. Residential roads were skinny switchbacks with some driveways were wooden pier-like platforms sticking out over the hill from the street.</p>

<p>After dropping our stuff off at the next Airbnb we headed out to find dinner. We lucked out and found a night market with copious amounts of street food. After this we wandered some more around the waterfront, then got all our Fitbit floors for the day walking up the hills home.</p>
