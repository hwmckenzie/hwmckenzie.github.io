<b><i>February 19-21</i></b>

<p>[Author’s note: since our return home, writing the blog posts has become more challenging… writing this post was assisted with some cider, to kindle the memories!]</p>

<p>We spent 3 hot, sunny, sweaty and wonderful days walking the coastal track in Abel Tasman National Park. The idea to stay overnight in the park was thanks to advice from Amy and Brad, and we’re sure glad we listened! Abel Tasman is both the smallest and most visited park in New Zealand, and we can definitely see why. There are beautiful beaches, a wide selection of walking tracks, a great shoreline for kayaking, and it is very accessible thanks to the water taxis. The park is named after Abel Tasman, a Dutch explorer who was the first European to reach New Zealand in 1642. Unfortunately for Tasman, he did not set foot on land and mistook the straight between the north and south islands as a bight. This was later corrected by James Cook, who first sighted New Zealand in 1769 and accurately charted the islands and initiated relations with the Maori.</p>

<p>Most of our first day was spent travelling to our starting point. This involved a short bus ride from Nelson to Marahau at the south end of the park, followed by a water taxi up the coast to the north end where we started the walk back. Due to the large tides, the water taxis are launched using tractors, and you board the boat on a trailer at the taxi shop and then they tow you down the road on a tractor and out to where the water is to launch. With 10+ boats launching at each departure time it is quite an operation!</p>

<p>After arriving in Marahau, we started at the Park Cafe with a coffee (of course!) and a received an orientation to our walk and our packed lunches. Then we set off to catch our water taxi. After some sightseeing in the water taxis, we were dropped off at Totaranui bay and we started our walk to Awaroa bay. This included traversing three beautiful beaches. We ate lunch and swam at Goat bay and then continued onward.</p>

<p>At Awaroa bay we crossed the estuary at low tide and it was amazing how many shells there were! Very sharp on the feet for those without sandals.</p>

<p>We arrived to find Awaroa Lodge to be quite fancy. We had our own little cabin, which looked like a beach resort hotel room, with a deck and our very own weka (a chicken-sized native flightless bird). Dinner was very tasty and enjoyed in a sun room overlooking a marsh (Bev and John, this is where the Christmas money was spent!).</p>

<p>After dinner we wandered down to see some glow worms. There were far fewer than the ones we saw while kayaking, but it was still neat to sit in the dark for a bit and watch them.</p>

<p>The second day was a big one and we walked from Awaroa to Anchorage bay. Before leaving Awaroa lodge we inquired at the desk about the advertised activity of “feeding the tame eels”. We were told we’d have to splash the meat around in the water as they are blind, and sent to the kitchen where we were given a tupperware with chunks of steak and chopsticks. Feeding the eels was really fun! They did really need help locating the meat, but weren’t shy about grabbing at it. I even lost a chopstick! This completed, we headed out as we had a tidal crossing to make.</p>

<p>On our approach to Bark bay we tried to take the low tide route, but we were a little early… Chris was optimistic and headed out, but ran into some difficulties and ended up with a slightly damp backpack! Being more cautious, I was well positioned to photograph from dry land!</p>

<p>We did swim over to the sand spit to further explore, but ended up taking the high tide route around to the main beach. After a long and lazy lunch at Bark bay, which we wrapped up at about 3:30pm, we (or I guess more accurately Hannah!) started to fret that we might not make the crossing. However, with some speedy walking we arrived in plenty of time. Crossing completed we rolled into our campsite, located our “glamping” tents, and collapsed into the waiting lawn chairs.</p>

<p>I should note that as we approached the campground we saw two baby wild boars. Quite something for me, as Seuss and I recently started a project to detect wild boar in Alberta. In both Alberta and New Zealand they are invasive and pests… though I have to admit these guys were pretty cute! At the campground there was some sort of school event going on and it was full of university students learning about Maori culture and doing the hakka, as well as high school students doing other activities. And wekas. Lots of determined and persistent wekas. We were warned that if we left our socks out to dry they would probably be stolen by a weka overnight! I guess they play the roll filled by chipmunks and squirrels at Canadian campsites! We were quite done in by this point, but located the cold shower near the beach and danced around in it to get the worst of the day's grim off. We were planning to do this in our bathing suites, but the European-sounding guy in front of us demonstrated that this was not necessary, so we followed his lead! Quite refreshing! We were then treated to a very tasty dinner cooked by our glamping host Sarah, including wine and dessert, before climbing atop our individual double decker blow up mattresses. I suppose having two makes it look more like a bed as it is higher off the ground, but I should have just slept on the ground as I spent a lot of the night trying not to topple over!</p>

<p>After our big second day we were mentally prepared for an “easy” last day. However, it turned out to be almost as long as our “big” day as we added in a side trip to Cleopatra’s pools. This was a neat pool beneath a series of small waterfalls, and quite refreshing.</p>

<p>After spending some time there we walked on with only quick peeks at the beaches we passed. We enjoyed our lunch at a private look-out by walking a bit past the end of the trail to the very end of the point. We could see kayakers paddling beneath us and it was quite relaxing. Our goal was to make it back to the Park Cafe for a cider before we had to be on the bus back to Nelson at 4:30! It was quite a lot of walking, and quite hot as well, and by the end I was referring to my legs as “my poor stumps”! The trail was quite well maintained, and at one point we met a couple with a young girl who was riding one of those strider bikes for kids with no pedals. We passed them, but it was touch a go for a while as that kid could really go on her bike! We lost her after a particularly root-y section though and could then relax! We very much enjoyed our cider and took the bus back to our little Airbnb in Nelson.</p>

<p>It was a great walk, made all the more enjoyable because we didn’t have to carry anything other than a day pack. We met many hikers on the trail who were self-supported and carrying everything on their backs. Our impression was that they weren’t having a great time and seemed to be in pain! We on the other hand felt light and speedy. I definitely have a new appreciation for how nice it is to recreate in luxury :)</p>
