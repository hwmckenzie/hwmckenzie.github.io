<h5>February 22-23</h5>

<p>Friday (the 22nd) was supposed to be a slow day in Nelson as we recovered from our Abel Tasman walk. Of highest importance (for me, at least) was doing some laundry, as by this point all my clothes suitable for hiking had been worn front, back, and inside out. Despite our Airbnb host advertising the ability to do laundry, she seemed cool to the idea of us using her washer. The next morning we were surprised by our host's visiting nurse, who was eager to show us the washer and how to use it. In New Zealand hanging one's laundry to dry appears to be the norm, and I know I saw a few houses that only seemed to have washers (no dryers). Finding a drying line out back, Hannah and I hung our laundry to dry for the second time on our trip.</p>

<p>While hopping in and out to move our laundry along the wash/dry process, we had coffee (and accompanying snacks) at two different cafes and ate lunch at a notably delicious vegetarian (maybe vegan?) restaurant. Once laundry was dry and folded we set off on a bit of a trek with the loose goal of hitting the Nelson waterfront. Comparatively, there wasn't much of note. Nelson is dry and the waterfront isn't so pretty when the tide isn't in. We werenâ€™t even able to make it to the Centre of New Zeland as the area was closed due to the total fire ban.</p>

<p>In the morning we woke up early-ish, packed up, and headed for our bus back to Picton. That day we would be taking a mail boat around the Queen Charlotte Sound, and the next was a train trip south to Christchurch. Before the bus we stopped to buy monster chocolate chip cookies we had scoped out the previous day, then headed to Subway in the hopes of a quick and cheap breakfast.</p>

<p>The mail boat didn't seem to be what Hannah expected. It was difficult to hear what the captain was saying, and from what could be heard it sounded like it was interesting stuff. For instance, deer have been seen swimming between islands that are up to 180 meters apart (maybe?) The weather was wet, sunny, and grey which I didn't mind so much, as I had the conflicting goals of wanting nice weather, but not wanting to put on sunscreen.</p>

<p>The places our boat stopped were truly beautiful. Most the houses were incredibly isolated, with many relying on solar power and rain water. Everyone who met the boat to get their mail seemed very happy, and this included dogs for whom the captain had treats waiting. The captain was also the recipient of treats himself and let us eat the pears and grapes he had been gifted.</p>

<p>Once back to Picton we walked to our Airbnb for the night, heading out again only briefly for some dinner.</p>
