<h5>February 24</h5>

<p>We woke up in our cosy Airbnb in Picton to a downpour outside. This is the first serious rain we experienced while in NZ. Although it put a bit of a damper on our day, it is very welcome as everything is so dry here. We decided that all that was needed was the proper preparation, and with the pack cover we brought and some creativity applied to a Countdown (NZ grocery chain) bag, we were all set!</p>

<p>We braved the short walk from the Airbnb to a cafe for breakfast. Though we did get quite wet (being right on the bay, some of the rain was horizontal!), we had plenty of time to dry off while enjoying a coffee, breakfast, and some time to write postcards. Mopping one’s face with a pack towel while in a restaurant is totally normal right?! After this strong start, we headed to the train station where we planned to catch the Costal Pacific train from Picton to Christchurch. Kiwi Rail describes it as “a train journey along the edge of the world”… and I guess it turned out to be just a little too close to the edge. We learned upon arriving at the station that with all the rain there had been a “slip” in the track (which seems to be the Kiwi vocabulary for “washout”), and the train was cancelled for the day. There was still the option to travel to Christchurch via the bus, which after some hasty discussion, we decided to accept. However, it wasn’t clear what time the buses would show up, or what time (if at all) they would deliver us to Christchurch, this due to the fact that the highway parallels the train tracks, and thus was at risk from similar “slips”. Thus ensued some waiting, and we passed the time with many cups of coffee and baking at local eating establishments, wandering around the several blocks near the train station, trying to look for any approaching buses, and taking many trips to the public restroom (due to the coffee!).</p>

<p>The buses did arrive, and in the end the journey wasn’t as long or as arduous as I feared it might be. We did get to see some of the scenery along the coast before it got dark, which included several large seal colonies and many crashing waves.</p>

<p>We arrived in Christchurch quite late and quite tired, but had a nice walk from the train station to the YMCA where Chris had secured us a room. I was sure happy to get into bed that night and slept like a log!</p> 

<p>As I write this post (March 28), it is strange to think that we walked through Hagley Park that night. The Al Noor Mosque is on the west side of the park, and was one of the mosques attacked during the terrorist attack on March 15 in which 50 people were killed. It is hard to reconcile that horrific event with my memories of Hagley Park and Christchurch. But I suppose that is most often the case with these sorts of events.</p>
