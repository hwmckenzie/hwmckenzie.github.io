<b><i>February 25</i></b>

<p>We only had one day in Christchurch, which was unfortunate as I believe there was a lot to see in the city and nearby. We were originally planning to meet James and Natasha, a husband and wife who own A Nose for Conservation, a company that works with detection dogs to protect New Zealand’s native birds including kiwi, kakapo, and whio. However, due to our travel delays from Picton, we had to pass up their hospitality in favour of one day to explore the city.</p>

<p>As the weather was still very wet in the morning, we decided to seek out an indoor activity, and chose the International Antarctic Centre. New Zealand is the jumping off point for travel to Antarctica and also maintains the Scott Base research station. In addition, we figured it would help us prepare for our approaching return to an Alberta winter that was shaping up to be one of the coldest in recent memory!</p>

<p>Upon arrival at the centre we were excited to get to meet the huskies! It had been a long time since we’ve seen our dogs, and we were pretty happy to get some canine snuggles. We learned that huskies were a big part of early Antarctic exploration. The dogs we met were from Husky Rescue NZ and very sociable.</p>

<p>After some quality time with the huskies, we went inside to check out the exhibits. We wandered through the displays, including the Antarctic Storm room (where the temperature dropped to -18C, including windchill… but don’t worry, they provided jackets!) and the Polar Plunge Challenge (where Chris stuck his hand into icy water).</p>

<p>We also watched a movie in the 4D theatre (where the seats moved and we got sprayed with water), and attended a talk about penguins, which we enjoyed while watching the centre’s little blue penguins (who were all rescued) swim, walk, and frolic around their indoor/outdoor environment.</p>

<p>Our entry ticket also included a ride on a Hagglund, an all-terrain amphibious vehicle that was well-suited to travel over the rough terrain and ice of Antarctica. We rode with a group of older tourists from somewhere in Europe, and we all enjoyed it quite a lot. The driver advised us to hang on the to handles and he was right! We navigated an obstacle course intended to replicate travel across ice, up and down hills, over crevasses, and through water.</p>

<p>After our trip to Antarctica, we did a 180 and enjoyed some Mexican food to warm up. Then we walked around the botanic gardens, which made me wish I had landscaping at home that would require a whole fleet of gardeners to maintain (and an entirely different climate!). We also saw some people punting on the Avon, which is a classic Christchurch experience.</p>

<p>To end our snapshot view of Christchurch, we headed back to our Airbnb to get ready for our early morning flight back to the North island and Auckland. Hard to believe we only have 1.5 days left of our trip!</p>
