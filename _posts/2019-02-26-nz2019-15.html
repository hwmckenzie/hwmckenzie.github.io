<b><i>February 26</i></b>

<p>Today we came back to the beginning. It took us 17 days to travel from Auckland to Christchurch by car, train, boat and foot. This morning we made the return trip by plane in 2 hrs. After dropping our bags at the very nice YMCA hotel, we headed out on foot to see the sights. First was a quick stop for lunch at a very tasty greek place that opened onto the street. We were in time to beat the lunchtime rush and were headed out on our afternoon adventure as the office workers were arriving. On the way to the waterfront we passed a park with uniformed school children playing (behaving in very un-uniform-suited ways!)</p>

<p>We walked to the waterfront and then along it as far as our feet would carry us. There was quite a lot of construction in the main part, and the buildings went right up to the water giving it a feeling of a very busy place indeed.</p>

<p>We even spotted some working dogs. After a bit of hovering with a professional sense of awe, Hannah asked if they were invasive species detection dogs, but they turned out to be explosives dogs. After we made our way out of the downtown core, we could see further into the harbour. Quite impressive! There were many sailboats at anchor and people sailing, surfing, and paddling along the edges of the main bay.</p>

<p>We stopped at the beach at Okahu Bay to sit and take stock. With a yen seeing more of the sights, we turned back towards downtown, caught a Lyft (before we wore our feet out entirely!) and headed for the Skytower.</p>

<p>The tower opened in 1997 and is 328 m high. It features such high flying adventures as the SkyWalk (where you walk around the tower on a walkway, tethered in) and the SkyJump (self explanatory!). In fact, as we arrived we saw someone base jump off the tower and come to a landing, assisted by a wire. Quite something! We purchased our tickets (sans SkyJump add-on!) and took the elevator up to the Main Observation deck located at level 51. The views were truly amazing!</p>

<p>It was quite neat to see where we had walked and to put it in perspective with the rest of the city. I experienced my own version of the SkyJump by inching my tipy-toes out over the glass floor. Oddly enough the knowledge that it was probably thicker than the solid floor I was standing on was not reassuring!</p>

<p>Chris was much more comfortable with the laws of physics and boldly stepped right on it!</p>

<p>We continued up to the Sky Deck at level 60 and the highest public observation deck, where the seamless glass almost made it feel like you were outside.</p>

<p>We had planned to splurge and dine at the Sugar Club, but they didn’t have any room, so we contented ourselves with a high altitude and very refreshing cider at the Sky Cafe.</p>

<p>After returning to the earth, we decided to start walking back to our hotel and seek out food along the way. Readers could probably guess that this has historically NOT been a good strategy for us (think hangry, yet picky and indecisive Hannah!). But on this night the stars aligned and we stumbled upon a very unique place. Through an unremarkable wooden door we found Elliot Stables, which claims to be, and indeed is, “an enchanting dinning village in the heart of the city, with twelve international eateries offering ethnic and local fare”. Not only did we get to eat tasty food in a wonderful ambience, and select exactly what we each wanted from different restaurants, but it was quite reasonably priced and fast! A real gem!</p>

<p>Appetites satisfied, we finished our walk home to enjoy our last sleep in NZ with our own private view of the Skytower.</p>
