<h5>February 27</h5>

<p>The inspiration for our final day in NZ came from Lea-Marie. Lea was my first international travel companion and I could not have learned the associated joys, sorrows, and skills from anyone better. After travelling around the big island of Hawaii, on our last day Lea said we should go to the beach. And so we found ourselves boarding the plane home with hair still wet from the ocean. I felt like I really got every minute I could have out of that trip and I wanted to feel the same way about NZ.</p>

<p>With this in mind, we boarded a ferry and soon found ourselves cruising through the Auckland harbour en route to Waiheki island.</p>

<p>Once there we hopped on the double decker hop-on hop-off bus, complete with commentary and headed out on what many websites described as a “wonderful day trip full of beautiful beaches, bohemian artists, award-winning vineyards, olive groves, and restaurants”, not to mention swimming, kayaking, hiking, and a zip-line. Now, some of you may already be thinking that all of that sounds like a bit much to fit into one day. Well, you would be right! Oddly enough, we did not come to that realization until after enjoying a very relaxing breakfast in a cute cafe in Oneroa village.</p>

It hit while we were waiting for our bus at stop #1 with 16 more stops to explore “at our own pace”, that perhaps there was a problem! We did our best. The next stop we chose was at Wild on Waiheke, where we tasted some craft beer and cider, and even squeezed in a game of bean bag toss. This stop also boasted six other wineries within walking distance, but sadly we had to skip those.</p>

<p>We hoped back on the bus and headed for Onetangi beach, a 2.5 km strip of white sand. It was beautiful! We enjoyed a swim, and there was even an outdoor shower to ensure we didn’t end up sitting in sandy underwear for the whole long plane ride home! We made one more quick stop to grab some lunch and took it to go on the bus back to the ferry, after which we walked briskly up the hill to our hotel for our luggage and to catch our taxi to the airport. I don’t think we could have squeezed more enjoyment out of our trip. It was truly an amazing experience, and looking back at our photos while writing this blog I can’t believe all of the things we saw and did. Here’s hoping it is one of many more to come :)</p>
