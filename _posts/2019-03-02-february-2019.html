<p>As many readers are aware, Chris and I spent most of February in New Zealand on our honeymoon, which you can read all about starting with the <a href="https://hwmckenzie.github.io/travels/2019/02/02/nz2019-1.html"><u>first post</u></a>. The travel blog is a work in progress and we are still writing about the last part of our trip. On our last day we visited “the strand”, a wonderful white sand beach on Waiheke island near Auckland, in order to fortify ourselves for the return to winter. Which by all accounts has been extremely cold. The coldest February on record in 40 years!</p>

<p>While we were away Sadie, Seuss, and Revi had a vacation at The Ranch Kennels (a great place, but sadly the pool and tennis courts are not open in the winter!), and Tammi enjoyed the good life as an only dog with Marlene and Ron. Our cabin fared well during our absence, and all our birds stayed happy, thanks to several visits by Marlene to check on the property and ensure the feeders stayed full.</p>

<p>We also received the results of Revi’s DNA test. She is 75-100% Siberian husky and 10-20% Irish setter. I guess that explains why she looks so much like Sadie (who is mostly Siberian husky as well)!</p>

<p>We returned to catch the tail end of February and are looking forward to spring, however distant it might seem at the moment. Chris read me a list he found in the Edmonton’s Wild Bird Store newsletter of activities birds will be engaged in next month. It included such things as: many birds returning from their warmer wintering grounds (I hope they didn’t book an early flight!), nest preparations, and courting. Based on the current temperatures, I feel we must have very optimistic birds! However, as good landlords we will be inspecting and cleaning out the bird boxes we built last year. Not to be outdone by the birds, I may also start pondering what landscaping/gardening projects we might undertake this year. However, I commit (here in writing!) to keeping it simple and aim for projects that are low maintenance going forward.</p>

<h5>Food & drink we enjoyed in NZ</h5> 
(as this month, I took a break from cooking!)</h5>
<ul> 
<li>Apple cider. Particularly Mac’s cloudy apple (unfiltered) and Zefer apple crumble (sweeter than I thought I would enjoy, but really hit the spot on a hot afternoon).</li>
<li>Toasted museli. It was everywhere, often homemade, and came in all sorts of varieties. I feel encouraged to start making our own at home. Steph and I sure made some tasty granola in our short-lived home on 61st ave in Edmonton. We’ll see!</li>
<li>Coffee. Kiwis are very passionate about their coffee, in particular the “flat white”.</li>
<li>Fresh seafood. A definite benefit of spending time in a country where almost all of the major settled areas are on the coast.</li>
 <li><a href="https://www.osm.nz"><u>OSM (a.k.a. “one square meal”) bars</u></a>. We only tried the apricot flavour, but I expect they would all be very tasty.</li>
</ul>
