<p><b><i>March 2nd</i></b><br>After a winter of chickadees, nuthatches, and woodpeckers, the redpolls arrived in force today. <i>[Update: the redpolls only stuck around for a week or so and then moved on. A good thing too as they have a very healthy appetite!]</i></p>

<p><b><i>...the Rest of March!</i></b><br>It seems that I am taking a “write the monthly blog at the end of the month” approach. After consideration, I’ve decided that I am ok with that! The goal of this blog was to document the happenings at our property. So, if something important occurs on a particular date, I’ll record the date. Otherwise, it can all just fall under the broad category of “monthly report”.</p>

<p>Lots of changes at the property this month. Temperatures ranged from -22&#x2103 to 12&#x2103, and the melting is proceeding in a very orderly fashion with the majority of the snow now gone. The slow melt is a relief as the consequences of a muddy yard are real with the dogs going in and out at regular intervals, and of course they have no personal interest in preserving the cleanliness of our house! The arrival of spring is getting me excited about gardening, though Chris reports he has heard we should expect a “second winter” soon. Hopefully that forecast does not bear fruit!</p>

<p>Revi continues to settle in well. Chris has taken charge of keeping her with us on our walks in order to practice in preparation for being a solo dog parent while Seuss and I are in California for the first half of April. He is doing very well and I expect things will go smoothly, unless the wily older sisters (Sadie and Tammi) decide to make an opportunistic break for freedom while Chris’s attention is focused on Revi! I will read Sadie the riot act before I leave and cross my fingers!</p>

<p>Marlene came to visit us this month and brought out new (custom designed and made by her!) curtains for our patio door. The timing of this is perfect as the sun will soon be high enough to blaze into the house during the day and these curtains are essential for keeping it cool inside. They are awaiting a final design touch, but once that is in place I will share a photo as they look very good!</p>

<p>Chris and I did something this month we have been talking about since we first moved to the property. We demolished the chicken coop! This was a very suspect building near Chris’s office shed which has likely been home to many squirrels over the years. We discovered what must have been a multi-generational cache of dried mushrooms and pine cones! Unfortunately they had also made nests out of most of the insulation, which made cleanup a bit messy. However, we got the structure down in one day and finished the burning and site clean up on the second day. The floor is still in place, but hopefully we can tear that out soon and level the area in time for some grass to take hold this spring and summer. One thing we regretted was burning most of what was cached inside the shed. In retrospect I wish we had just shovelled it into the surrounding bush so it could be recovered by the squirrels and re-cached somewhere else. Chris reported that the next day he watched a sad and irate squirrel chase blue jays away from the site while what remained was scavenged by a variety of animals. However, upon reflection I don't feel too concerned for the squirrels as they have been visiting our bird feeders all winter and therefore I suspect are in good condition!</p>

<p>Another long awaited activity we finally did was to gaze at the stars while lounging in Chris’s double hammock. We did this on a chilly wintery night, and though it was a little cloudy we did get treated to some coyote howling shortly after we settled into the blankets. It was quite cosy and relaxing, and definitely on the list to do more often.</p>

<p>As we mentioned in last month’s post, March was the month we cleaned out our bird boxes in preparation for this year’s tenants. All of the boxes we had up got used, and appeared for the most part to have the same kind of nest made primarily of coarse twigs. Sadly we found quite a few dead birds in the boxes, all tree swallows. One box had four. After some reading it seems that this species is particularly susceptible to dying, either from starvation and hypothermia during cold, wet weather when none of the flying insects that they feed on are out and about (likely the fate of the 4 adult birds we found), or due to competition from house wrens and house sparrows. The latter species will actually trap a tree swallow in its box and then construct its nest right on top of it. What a rotten bird! To minimize this competition we may need to move some of our boxes, but so far we have left everything in place and will plan to more closely monitor the boxes to see exactly who is using them. We are also hoping to encourage chickadees to use our boxes as the holes are the right size and we certainly had many overwinter with us this year. To make the boxes more appealing for chickadees this year we added a few inches of wood shavings to the bottom of some boxes. Apparently they like the activity of “digging out” their nests so much it is a prerequisite when selecting a nesting site! With the warmer days we are starting to see the return of many migratory geese, and I expect the songbirds will arrive soon as well, so stay tuned for further bird developments.</p>

<p>We also tried our hands at some art! I found this neat YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ArtforKidsHub"><u>Art for Kids Hub</u></a> where you can get step-by-step instructions to follow along and draw a wide range of things. So far we have stuck to dogs, and a robin to herald the arrival of spring. Great for kids I’m sure, but a fun date night for adults as well!</p>

<p><b><i>March's “Week of Bowls”</i></b><br>
<ul> 
<li><a href="https://cookieandkate.com/2015/vegan-sweet-potato-green-rice-burrito-bowls/"><u>Black bean and sweet potato bowl with green rice</u></a>. I made the rice with fozen spinach for the "green" part.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.jennikayne.com/ripandtan/recipe-of-the-day-middle-eastern-grilled-vegetable-lentil-bowl"><u>Middle eastern grilled vegetable lentil bowl</u></a>.</li>
<li>Ukranian bowl (perogies, borscht, sausage, and sauteed cabbage). This one was easy as Chris took care of cooking the perogies and the borscht was provided by Marlene! And it was so good we had it again the next week!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bbc.com/food/recipes/spicy_squash_and_feta_45773"><u>Butternut squash frittata</u></a>. Perhaps a stretch to consider this a “bowl”… but I did serve it in a bowl!</li>
<li>Buffalo chicken pasta with broccoli (forgot to take the photo!)</li>
