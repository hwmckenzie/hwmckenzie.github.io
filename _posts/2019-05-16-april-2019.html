<p><i>[Author’s note: In re-reading this post, I realized that it is mostly just a big update on the spring fauna and flora here at the property, with my witty (I flatter myself) comments interspersed. Consider yourself warned!]</i></p>

<p>Spring officially arrived at the property on April 5th when we sighted our first robin of the year! That was the only old wives’s saying that was born out this month as we were woefully short on April showers. Despite that, we did spot the prairie crocuses in the Conservation Area (April 17) as well as on our hill.</p>

<p>We were also surprised by the unexpected appearance of striped squill near our house. These flowers must have bloomed from some of the dozens of bulbs brought back by Hannah from Veseys in PEI and planted in 2016. To date only a handful have ever come up, but seeing these gives me hope there may be some more underground just waiting for the right conditions!</p>

<p>The arrival of the robin was just the first of many feathered visitors this month. The spring migration is definitely on. We were visited by a pair of purple finches, who were soon followed by a whole flock that proceeded to put a big dent in our birdseed budget in short order! We also experienced many flyovers by a variety of geese on their way north. One moment in particular was very moving as a huge flock came on in front of big dark storm clouds and rising wind. They were either running from it or surfing the storm front. They made patterns like giant fractals in the sky and I felt quite humbled.</p>

<p>To round out the bird report, we learned what grouse poop looks like (not what you’d expect!), spotted a fox sparrow at the feeder (a new bird for us), and tried to revive a purple finch after she flew into our front door by having her overnight in a box in our bathroom. Unfortunately she was too badly injured and passed away in the night. Bird collisions are not infrequent during the summer, despite us decorating our windows with stickers that are supposed to prevent them. Hopefully we are still having a net positive impact on the birds around us despite this, although I would like to find a way to more effectively signal to the birds that our windows aren’t doors. In addition to food and water, this year we also offered nesting materials courtesy of the dogs. We put dog hair in a mesh bag and hung it out, without much faith that any birds would actually take it… Imagine our delight when we saw a chickadee wrestle a tuft of hair out of the bag, sit on a branch in apparent contemplation about where to take his or her prize. Chris wondered if maybe the bird had put the cart before the horse and gotten the lining before building the nest! However, it did eventually fly away, so in a little while there may be baby chickadees nestled in Sadie or Tammi or Seuss or Revi’s fur!</p>

<p>Hannah and Sadie spent a week away from home this month in California working with a wonderful dog trainer. While they were away, Chris spotted our resident bear, and at least one cub. We have since captured bears (we are unsure if these are all the same or different?) several times on one of our trail cameras, so they are out and about near the property as in previous years.</p>

<p>With the arrival of spring and the strengthening of the sun, our deck has again become a small patch of scorched earth. To try to provide some shade, we purchased a new free-standing, very cheery yellow umbrella. In theory, this means we can move it around the deck to provide optimal shade according to the time of day. In practice, this means it takes flight on a relatively regular basis, leading the dogs to vacate the deck entirely in search of more predictable snoozing environs. We have since confined it to the middle of our patio table, although this has only partially kept it on the ground. In all fairness, it has been a very windy spring!</p>

<p>This month we also renewed our efforts towards landscaping and outdoor beautification. For a start, we resumed work to rescue items from the pigeon barn. For those unfamiliar with this structure, it is an old and picturesque barn, which has been mostly taken over by pigeons, who by all accounts spend a significant amount of time and energy aiming their poop at our stuff. We put our pressure washer to work and got most of our things out and at least superficially sprayed down, starting with our bikes. It was quite disgusting! In a show of solidarity, the dogs (I suspect Revi and Sadie) continue to hunt the pigeons whenever they happen to descend to ground level.</p>

<p>We have also tried again to convince grass to grow around our main yard area, as we feel we can only use the excuse "the house was just recently built!" as an explanation for why we are surrounded by mud flats for so long. We will report on results, but due to the aforementioned lack of showers, I expect we will need to do quite a bit of watering to convince the seeds that our lawn is a good place to set up shop.</p>

<p><b><i>A few other noteworthy things from April</i></b>
<ul>
<li>Our water tastes better and we have stopped using the Brita filter for our drinking water. (Related to this, we have installed a ring of rocks around the well cap in an effort to prevent grass from growing up under it and eventually falling into the well and rotting…. possibly the source of the compost/swamp taste in our water?)</li>
<li>Hannah turned 38!</li>
<li>Alberta elected a new government (the United Conservative Party). No pipelines materialized overnight and it remains to be seen what life under a UCP government will be like.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><b><i>April’s recipe recommendations</i></b>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/242352/greek-lemon-chicken-and-potatoes/">Lemon chicken thighs with potatoes</a>.
Very tasty, super easy. Cook everything in one pan unattended in the oven, just add a veggie side. I used boneless thighs.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/tasty-burritos/">Tasty Burritos</a>. Don’t skip the final step of browning the burrito in the pan, it takes it to the next level! Best enjoyed with salsa and sour cream. Also they freeze well, just wrap in paper towel before freezing and reheat in the microwave. You could easily add more veggies to the filling (butternut squash would be a good addition).</li>
