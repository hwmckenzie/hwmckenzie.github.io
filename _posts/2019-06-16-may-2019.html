<p>May reminds me of how September used to feel when I went back to school and got back into all my regular routines. This is my fifth year in as part of the watercraft inspections program, and there is definitely an annual cycle. For Seuss and I, May started out with a two-week trip to Lethbridge to help train this year’s cohort of watercraft inspectors. A good group, and Seuss enjoyed his walks in the coulees, but we were glad to get back to Chris, the dogs and the property!</p>

<p>To kick off a month of bird sightings, on May 1st Chris spotted a yellow-rumped warbler, a new bird for us, and even got a photo!</p>

<p>Mid-may brought white-throated sparrows, a pair of yellow-bellied sap suckers, and a brief visit by a flock of pine siskins. Chris also spotted a Baltimore oriole (May 17), and the hummingbirds are back. The tree swallows are also here in force and are occupying most of our bird boxes. We have also seen a house wren, and we plan to keep a close eye on activity to see if we notice any harassment of the swallows, or if any of them get kicked out of their boxes by the wren.</p>

<p>Another, slightly different, winter migrant arrived at our house this month via the mailbox. The postcard we sent ourselves during our stopover in the Bahamas on our Christmas cruise finally made it! We have had similar reports from others as well. Why it took them so long to arrive and what they have been doing all these months will forever remain a mystery!</p>

<p>Despite the lack of showers in April, many plants still valiantly bloomed in May. We enjoyed a beautiful, though short-lived, blanket of white flowers on the saskatoon bushes (fingers crossed for lots of berries!), yellow golden beans, and three-flowered avens. Most of the wildflowers we see are next door in the conservation area, or on our hill, which seems to be closer to a natural prairie grass community as compared to the quack grass monoculture that dominates near our house. Over time I would like to help the native plants replace the quack grass, but I suspect this will be a challenge. We have discussed getting some goats to assist with the mowing, though we haven’t taken the plunge yet! Near our house, the lilacs also started to bloom with the promise of a very good display this year.</p>

<p>There is also an update on the patio umbrella, newly purchased at moderate expense in May. On one of its trips across the yard it landed poorly and broke two arms. Saddened by the loss of our umbrella at such a young age, and very much in need of it, we turned to the internet for help. It turns out that umbrellas break quite frequently, always in the same spot, and there are many helpful videos of people showing you how to fix them! After reviewing a few, and taking a trip to the Home Hardware in Vegreville for supplies, Chris and I went to our workbench (a.k.a the patio table!) to see if our handyman skills were up to the challenge of getting our umbrella back on its stand. As you can see from the photo below the repair was successful! We also modified how it is attached under the table, so I believe the umbrella has taken its final flight!</p>

<p>Revi learned about skunks this month, though luckily she was only “misted” and didn’t receive a comprehensive lesson! She did however receive several baths before being allowed to sleep in the house that night. I suspect she thought the skunk was much more exciting than the baths!</p>

<p>Our trail cameras also captured two bears several times next door in the conservation area. Hopefully Revi and the other dogs don’t get any lessons from them! We carry bear spray when we walk next door now, and Hannah has dusted off her original song from 2017:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">Hey bear,<br>
How are you today bear?<br>
I don’t want to meet you, greet you, serve meat to you!<br>
<br>
Hey bear,<br> 
Where are you today bear?<br>
Why don’t you stay there,<br>
Bear, bear, bear!</blockquote>

<p>Marlene came to visit at the end of the month and we continued work on the Garden originally put in by Bev and Hannah a few summers ago. It is a capitol G-garden because Bev and Hannah were nearly done in after the three days it took to dig and plant it in 2017! After a summer fighting with the quack grass, which insists it was there first and will be there last, Marlene and Hannah took action to move towards a lower maintenance solution by changing tactics. Instead of trying to keep the grass out of the garden bed (which was dug with much sweat on the part of the Mckenzie girls!), we are allowing it to do what it will everywhere except for in the newly installed garden boxes. These will provide safe havens for the plants and hopefully save Hannah’s sanity (as well as Chris’s who was heroically trying to mow around but not over tiny plants lost in an ocean of grass!). We lined the boxes on the bottom with landscape fabric (two layers!) and inside with foam. Hopefully this will ensure they are both grass-free and the plants survive the winter. Marlene reports good success with the foam, so fingers crossed! We also grouped together some of the larger plants which will continue to coexist with the grass, to hopefully make mowing easier.</p>

<p>As a reward for all our hard planting work, Chris picked up pizza from the gas station and we enjoyed it with beer. There have been a number of large forest fires in Alberta so far this spring, and late in the day it got quite smokey.</p>

<p>More serious planting of crops happened in the fields around us this month as well, although still only a sprinkle of rain, so everything is looking pretty dry and dusty.</p>

<p>We also had a bit of excitement next door at the conservation area. While driving past on our way to Vegreville to get groceries, we noticed some smoke drifting across the road, and then flames in the ditch! The series of events that followed this discovery, including calling 911, returning to the house for the fire extinguisher (it was still only a small grass fire), Chris putting out the fire, and then being on-scene when the Minburn County fire chief and the Innisfree Fire Department arrived to thoroughly douse the area, culminated in us being invited to the practice of Innisfree Volunteer Fire Departement… which it turned out was that same night! We went to the practice and I am excited to say it is the most people we have met since moving here in 2016! They gave us a tour of the fire hall and trucks, and showed us the gear they wear. I had the sneaking suspicion they were already eyeing us up for gear sizes. It is a small group and entirely volunteer. They meet every two weeks, so I’ll write about next instalment of this adventure next month.</p>

<p>After writing this post, I am taken by surprise at how much happened at the property this month! They say that life is made up of all the small moments, and I can certainly see how all the small things can fill up a life. It is nice to have the opportunity to reflect on the happenings around us at the property through this blog as I feel it means I get to live all those moments at least twice, and hopefully more when re-reading the posts down the road with a glass of wine in hand!</p>

<b><i>May’s recipe recommendations</i></b>
