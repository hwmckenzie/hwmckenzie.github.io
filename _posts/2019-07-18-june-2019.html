<p>The constant at the Property this month was meteorological volatility. Following a very dry May, we had snow (June 7), hail (June 21), and lots and lots of rain (dare I say almost daily?!). In fact, we installed irrigation for the trees on the shield on June 16th to try to help them recover from the heat and dryness of May, only to have it rain almost every day after that (of course!).</p>

<p>We are hoping that the rain will do wonders for our trees and garden, but these miracles of growth have yet to be realized as we haven’t had much heat for the plants to take advantage of all the new found moisture. Perhaps in July? We also noticed that many of the aspen trees have been affected by what we think is aspen leaf roller. This is a caterpillar that rolls itself up in the leaf so it is protected through metamorphosis. Apparently it is a common pest in the area this year. The trees will survive, but their appearance will be affected for the summer.</p>

<p>Although we don’t have a “real” vegetable garden this summer (sane heads prevailed there!), we did plant some potatoes in bags specifically designed for this purpose that we discovered in Chris’s gardening supplies. We also planted some in a box and some in the ground. I guess we’ll see which environment provides the best growing conditions when we harvest in the fall. So far all have sprouted and are growing nicely… even the one that somehow made it into the flower section of the garden!</p>

<p>With the dry start to the spring followed by all the rain, Chris has started measuring the well depth so we can see how fast our well refills. This involves locking all the dogs inside (we don’t want a canine version of the Lassie episode when little Timmy fell down the well!), and then Chris drops a plumb line down the well to measure the depth. Results to come.</p>

<p>Despite the increase in moisture, the Innisfree Fire Department remains in operation, and Chris and I seem to now be members and listen to the nightly radio check. We’ll keep you posted on if we are able to contribute!</p>

<p>Hannah was consumed with a small obsession this month. It started out as a date night activity, but turned into a single-player puzzle marathon lasting a week until it was finally completed and we recovered the use of the kitchen table. Needless to say, we might take a break from puzzles for a while!</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">The finished product.</span>

<p>We have some new neighbours… and they have more dogs than us! Five (5!) Dalmatians to be exact. Stephanie and Guillaume are a very nice couple from Quebec, with two daughters and four horses in addition to the aforementioned dogs. I baked cookies to welcome them to our little neighbourhood… but alas we did not run into them over the next few days and before long the cookie offering had diminished in size to the point where it was no longer presentable. So, I went back to the baking board, this time creating some apple carrot muffins. Happily, these did arrive at their destination and seemed to go over well with the kids. We haven’t had any more contact with them as I write this, but it is nice to have another family living nearby. And I live in the hopes that I may get to brush or perhaps even ride one of the horses someday.</p>

<p>A little closer to home, the birds are busy with their own spring activities. After several unsuccessful attempts to convince the waxwings to come check out our offerings by setting out frozen berries, they finally arrived… to eat all our haskaps! We also observed  a group of chickadee fledgelings being taught about the bird feeder. They reminded me of small children playing soccer, all mobbing each other and moving around awkwardly in a big happy clump. Very cute!</p>

<p>June came to a close with a disappearing act presented by Revi and Tammi. On Friday morning of the Canada Day weekend, one minute we were taking the dogs for a “quick walk” in anticipation of heading to Vermilion for the Canada Day events. The next we were tramping across fields in search of lost dogs. This was in fact not the first time these two had lead us, or particularly Chris, on a merry chase this month. I can only attribute the recent increase in wandering to more animal activity. This theory is supported by our trail camera photos, which include some very cute baby deer.</p>

<p>But, I digress. During one of our breaks at the house, while grabbing a quick snack before heading back out to continue the search (no doubt like many exasperated dog owners before us), we purchased a “Tractive”. This is a tracker that the dog wears that communicates with the satellites and then sends your phone the location of your rotten runaway doggie. Though it felt good to take some action, it was of course not very helpful to our immediate situation! Despite some frustration at having our day hijacked, we did enjoy a nice hike through the fields around our house, and stumbled upon a field of tiny wild strawberries at peak ripeness. That fact that they were growing in a field full of cow patties (presumably the cows were elsewhere) did not deter us from sampling the fruits. Upon our return, after finding the dogs (though in truth the dogs found us), I spent the rest of the day in the hammock recovering. I suppose I have the dogs to thank for helping me to enjoy our property in a way I wish I did more often (reclining in the hammock, not struggling through the bush!).</p>

<p>With June in the books, we are looking forward to what July has to offer.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">June’s recipe recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thepinningmama.com/hawaiian-barbecue-meatballs/#cookbook-recipe-16015">Slow cooker Hawaiian meatballs</a>. Super easy for those days when you’d rather be outside than cooking. We had them over rice. I’m sure I added a vegetable side, but I can’t remember what it was.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/moroccan-braised-beef/">Slow cooker moroccan beef stew</a>. Again, very easy. I didn’t braise the beef, but just threw everything in the slow cooker (and in my opinion you’d never know the difference). We ate it with roasted cauliflower. Would definitely make it again.</li>
</ul>
