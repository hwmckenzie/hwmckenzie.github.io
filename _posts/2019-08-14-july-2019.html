<p>It seemed like July arrived and left in the blink of an eye. June remains the record to beat for rain, but July was no slouch, hitting 3.91 inches (June was 5.33").</p>

<p>In June all the dogs, except Seuss, took turns running away and leading us on merry (and not so merry!) chases through field and forest. Not to be left out, Seuss staged his disappearing act at the beginning of this month, much to Hannah’s dismay (and pre-mature aging!). Then for good measure he staged an encore a week or so later. This second disappearing act also resulted in him losing his blue frisbee in a field of canola. We hope to recover it after harvest. Stay tuned for updates...</p>

<p>This led to us ordering a second Tractive, oddly enough, intended for Tammi. (The Tractive is a GPS+cellular tracking device that lets us track the dogs in semi-real time, assuming a cell signal). Near the end of July the anxiously awaited Tractive arrived and "Toodle-oo Tammi" and "Rotten Revi" (as we've named them in the app) took it for a test drive… and lost it! Both dogs were gone for a long time, and after listening to much coyote carrying-ons from the road, we walked in their direction along the edge of very dense canola fields. How the dogs make their way through these crop fields which tower above their heads is a mystery to me! After much yelling on our part, they returned, with one less Tractive than they took out. And of course Tammi was not “checking in” (when the Tractive tells your cell phone where it is), so we weren’t able to find it. We did go back that night and try, but as Chris said, it was "worse than looking for a needle in a haystack.”</p>

<p>Overall, the Tractives have fulfilled the promise of letting us know where the dogs are. They're not exactly live views, as to preserve power they normally only check in every 5-20 minutes. Also, depending on whether the unit has slid around to under the dog's neck, and whether or not they're in trees ... and whether or not we're in an area with good cell phone coverage, check-ins can come in up to an hour apart. Revi and Tammi are probably happy though, as we've gotten lax in trying to keep them around, and joke about how they now expect the "shuttle" to come pick them up if they get too far away.</p>

<p>New flowers continued to show up this month and we saw a scattering of wood lilies, which was quite neat as I think they are rare.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">One of the wood lilies we spotted on our property. As you can see it was also a good year for saskatoon berries (usually we only seem to get the flowers).</span>

<p>We also had some impressive blooms in our garden. Marlene gave us some shade loving plants to go beside Chris’s office. I was very impressed with their blooms!</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">The garden continues to fill in, but still has a way to go. Better photos next month. I think some changes are needed next year as some of the plants in the boxes are tall enough to be in the main garden to the right of the path (not shown here). Chris also caught a grouse in this photo.</span>

<p>We got ice cream at the Egg in Vegreville! This was a summer bucket list item, and we were more than happy to check it off. We saw that the kids in line in front of us got special decorations added to their cones, and it turned out that the special touch wasn’t just for kids!</p>

<p>We also responded to our first fire call this month. It was for a power pole that was reported to be on fire (although we later learned that it was in fact only the grass around the pole that was on fire). We rushed (safely!) to the fire hall, but when we got there the first truck had already left. Even though we are only 6 minutes away from Innisfree, it takes us longer to get there than many people who live right in town. Two others showed up to the hall but before we could leave with the second truck we heard on the radio that the fire was out. Despite not actually being part of putting out the fire, we felt it was a good first call and now feel much more prepared for the next one.</p>

In addition to protecting you from catching fire, those outfits are A) not intended to make you look slim, and B) would probably make you very slim if you wore them all the time because they are both heavy and very hot!</span>

<p>To wrap up the month we went to the Vermilion Fair to see the stock dog trials. The dogs had to herd a group of three sheep (which sometimes included a goat!) in a pattern around some barrels, through a narrow chute, and into very small pen. The handler had to stand on a mat at one end of the ring and could only direct the dog through a series of whistles and yelled commands. This turned out to be no easy feat and only one dog completed the course, with several handlers practically pulling out their hair in exasperation as they tried to guide their dogs from a distance! Several of the sheep were quite obstinate, and one poor border collie lost courage in the face of a particularly ornery sheep and got cornered by the fleecy group under the fence at one end of the ring until her owner came to her rescue! We enjoyed it very much, and it did get us thinking more about acquiring a few sheep or goats of our own.</p>

<p>And so July came to a close, and with August coming fast on its heels we are left contemplating how to squeeze more enjoyment out of this rapidly shortening summer.</p>

<p><b><i>July’s recipe recommendations</i></b><br>
Thanks to a generous donation of the vegetable, which masquerades as a fruit, from Marlene, July was all about what to do with rhubarb)
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cookieandkate.com/roasted-strawberry-rhubarb-and-yogurt-parfaits/"><u>Roasted rhubarb</u></a>. I came across this while looking for something slightly different than just boiling it with sugar. I made it twice, the first time I included the strawberries and the second time I did pure rhubarb. I don’t think I used the full amount of honey. Very tasty! I enjoyed it with yogurt and also made banana muffins, substituting the rhubarb for some of the bananas.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.bunsenburnerbakery.com/rhubarb-bbq-sauce/"><u>Rhubarb BBQ sauce</u></a>. This was a real winner! Very versatile. I used it to marinade chicken drumsticks that I cooked on the BBQ, but I also used it in a wrap, in scrambled eggs, and I think it would be delicious on a burger or over roasted potatoes.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.truefoodsblog.com/recipe/rhubarb-lentil-curry/"><u>Rhubarb lentil curry</u></a>. I was really excited about this one as it was truly a savoury use of rhubarb. Our version was tasty, but I made so many substitutions based on what we had in the house I can’t really say what the original recipe tasted like! Needless to say, I’m sure the tangy flavour would be the same, which was what made it unique.</li></ul></p>
