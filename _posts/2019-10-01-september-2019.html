<p>As you may recall, in August we built our first compost barrel to accommodate our increased supply of compost being picked up weekly from the Red Brick Cafe in Vermilion. With barrel number one quickly filling up, the start of September found us building barrel number two in earnest. Though this build went much more smoothly, there is still room for design adjustments, particularly with the door and getting the barrels to roll smoothly. It didn’t take long to fill up the second barrel with compost, so, at the end of the month, in an effort to ensure we have enough space to see us through the winter, we built a different model of composter.</p>

<p>The dogs continued their summer rampage this month with Revi meeting a new foe and Sadie picking up where she left off with an old vendetta. Their discovery of the porcupine simultaneously disrupted both our nice relaxing Sunday morning walk and our vet Dr. Copland’s Sunday morning sleep-in. Not to mention the quiet morning of the poor porcupine! Very luckily for us Dr. Copland, who lives about 10 minutes away and has her clinic on her farm, was willing to get up and help out our two poor decision-makers. By 10 am the dogs were de-quilled and sleeping off their anesthetic while the humans sipped coffee. The porcupine incident happened to coincide with our anniversary, so happy anniversary from the dogs!</p>

<p>In other dog news, Seuss joined the Tractive club this month. He normally doesn’t go for solo walks as I keep a very close eye on him. But, after two successful disappearing acts, we decided it was time. I reached this conclusion as I was laying face down in a wet canola field. A situation which came to pass as I was trying to find the dogs, but ended up tripping on ensnaring canola stalks, my wet pants, my undone shoelaces, or some combination thereof! It turns out that canola is surprisingly dense!</p>

<p>We also made a quick trip to the (big) cabin at Seba Beach the weekend after our anniversary. It was quite relaxing and gave Chris a chance to try out his birthday present from his Dad a little early, a drone! There were a few crashes, but we got some great pictures of the cabin and us kayaking.</p>

<p>The next weekend for Chris’s birthday, we finally realized our plan of having a picnic! Hannah organized a drone scavenger hunt, which Chris completed while we enjoyed lunch on the top of the hill with the dogs.</p>

<p>Harvest is in full swing now, and we responded with the fire department to a small fire which was started by some equipment harvesting pea straw. Although it was mostly out when we got there, Chris got to spray water from a nozzle on the front of the big fire truck and I got to help spray the hose from the small truck. So far we have been lucky that the calls we have gone to have been very small. We have a lot to learn.</p>

<h5>September's recipe recommendations</h5>
<p>I don’t seem to have any recipe recommendations from September. I think we must have eaten mostly meals from the freezer. Check back again next month!</p>
