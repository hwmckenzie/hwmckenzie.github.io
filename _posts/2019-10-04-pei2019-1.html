<b><i>October 3</i></b>

<p>We (Chris, Hannah, and Tammi!) headed off on a 10 day trip to Prince Edward Island. We were particularly looking forward to the trip as it was not only a chance to see Hannah’s parents, but also included a family gathering of many of the maritime Mckenzies and Whites, as well as Sandy, Marlene and Ron, who were flying in from the west.</p>

<p>It turned out that the first part of this adventure belongs to Tammi.</p>

<p>We dropped Sadie, Seuss, and Revi off at the kennel, and then after a night in Edmonton at Ron and Marlene’s, headed to the airport to get on our plane. All went smoothly checking in and getting Tammi through security. We got confirmation once we boarded that Tammi was on-board too and our flight to Toronto was uneventful. We changed planes in Toronto, and after getting confirmation that Tammi had also made the plane change, we were airborne and on our way to Charlottetown.</p>

<p>We arrived, and together with Bev and John, anxiously waited for Tammi to emerge from the oversized luggage door… and waited… and waited. No Tammi. A Westjet employee arrived and asked "are you waiting for a dog?", and when we say “yes", she said, “come with me”, which was very ominous indeed! It turns out that when they opened the cargo hold in Charlottetown, expecting to find a dog to unload… there was no dog! My whole stomach rolled into a tight ball and fell down into the pit and stayed there. Not only was Tammi not on our plane, they didn’t know where she was! It took them about 20 minutes to locate her somewhere at the Toronto airport. I’m not sure if those were the longest 20 minutes of my life, but certainly in recent memory. I’m sure they were pretty long for the Westjet staff as well, and longest for Chris. Everyone was pretty worried, but started to feel much better once Tammi was found. She would be overnighting in Toronto and then arriving the next night. So, we headed out to the parking lot to drive to Longview. Everyone was feeling a bit low, but luckily the Westjet person with Tammi called Chris right away to let him know they were with her and letting her out, and would be staying with her until someone took her to the kennel where she would be spending the night. Later that night it turned out that they weren’t able to get a hold of the kennel, so Tammi spent the night in the office with the Westjet staff, ate a lot of treats, and walked around the airport for her morning walk.</p>

<p>She arrived the next day, looking relatively unflustered considering all the excitement. Such a great dog!</p>
