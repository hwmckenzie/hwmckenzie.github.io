<b><i>October 4-6</i></b>

<i>Friday</i>

<p>After a good sleep in Muchs' cottage, shared with John and Joanie, and a restorative breakfast to recover from our day of travel, Chris and I visited a bit and assisted with some of the preparations.</p>

<p>Leaving the kitchen a hive of activity, we headed into Charlottetown to pick up Sandy. We planned to spend some time showing him the sights of Charlottetown while we waited for Tammi to arrive at dinner. Unfortunately it was grey and rainy. But, we did have a tasty sandwich at Leonhards and got re-caffeinated at the Receiver. Then, having still more time to spare, we decided to drive to take a look at the Confederation Bridge. Very grey and windy, but it was still there, linking the island to the mainland as advertised! Tammi arrived on time and was very happy to see us, but I think we were even happier to see her!</p>

<i>Saturday</i>

<p>Everyone not already present arrived during the morning on Saturday. Bob got the washer toss set up and allowed for warm-up rounds, though these were closely supervised by the peanut gallery!</p>

In between taking their turns at the washer toss, the tireless kitchen team, refreshed with new blood, were busy getting the kabobs ready for the grill for dinner.

When all the tosses were accounted for, the participants flocked inside for a tasty lunch of soup and sandwiches, and a bit of relaxing before the next activity.

After lunch, we all headed over to Jim and Bev’s garden to see what was ready to harvest. Even though the garden suffered some damage from the hurricane, with Jim’s help and direction, everyone left with bags full of carrots, potatoes, and turnips, among other veggies. Some of which travelled as far as Alberta before being eaten!

<p>We all returned to Longview, and after a bit of a break reconvened for the medal presentations. Bob had arranged for real medals and Mary had sewn a cushion, which lent quite an air of celebration to the presentations!</p>

<p>While everyone received participant ribbons, medallists included Marlene, Chris, Josh, Sydney and Donnie, with Julia being the big winner!</p>

<p>Following the awards ceremony we all tucked in to a tasty dinner, with kabobs grilled to perfection by John Mckenzie and John Veinotte, tasty salads, and herbed rice thanks again to the kitchen team!</p>

<p>After dinner there was a bonfire with s’mores, but after such a busy day, everyone disappeared to find their beds pretty quickly. Hard to believe we fit so much into one day!</p>

<i>Sunday

<p>Sunday morning dawned bright and sunny, and found us enjoying yet another tasty meal and drawing for the “date night ideas” raffle prize baskets. While she was denied on the ring toss field this year, Cindy was big winner of the prize basket draw!</p>

<p>With lots of hugs and goodbyes, we brought to a close the 2019 PEI Family Gathering. It sure was quite the event, and I felt really happy to have the chance to catch up with family I knew and meet family I had not met yet. It was also really special to be able to have everyone meet Chris, Sandy, Marlene and Ron. A very big thanks to everyone who worked so hard to make it possible, certainly it will be talked about for years to come!</p>
