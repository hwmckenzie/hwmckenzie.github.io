<b><i>October 6-11</i></b>

<p>On Sunday afternoon before Sandy left we took Tammi to the St. Peter’s harbour beach and Chris flew his drone. Although Tammi was initially interested in the water, she quickly decided that salt water was not for her.</p>

<p>After the beach we went into Charlottetown to take in a bit of Farm Day in the City. We parked at the condo, which was a good thing as the waterfront was packed with people! We walked around town, found the PEI cow, ate very tasty lobster rolls at the park, and then dropped Sandy off at the airport. I think Tammi was quite relieved that she wasn’t getting back on a plane just yet!</p>

<p>Following the excitement of the family gathering, everyone at the cottage took a few days to relax and we enjoyed several days of spectacular fall weather. On Monday Chris, Tammi and I all laid pretty low, though we did get out on the trail for a walk, where Tammi discovered that the squirrels of PEI deserved to be chased just as much as the squirrels back home.</p>

<p>Tuesday was another relaxing and beautiful day, so Chris spent some time flying his drone and got some great photos of the cottage. He also did an aerial inspection of the roof, which confirmed my Dad’s suspicion that there were damaged shingles.</p>

<p>On Wednesday we took a drive to Georgetown to do some apple picking and sightseeing. There were lots of different kinds of apples and picking them was really fun. The only hard part was not picking too many as we were only in PEI for one more day! Tammi was able to join us, and I think she quite enjoyed strolling around the rows.</p>

<p>After the orchard, we did some more walking on the beach and found a small lighthouse. Then we went into Georgetown proper and had some coffee and a cinnamon bun, and Hannah found a silversmith shop where she bought a replacement for the wedding ring that was lost over the summer.</p>

<p>Thursday was our last full day in PEI and we spent it in Charlottetown and then stayed the night at the condo as our flight the next day was quite early. Hannah got a haircut (a strange tradition she seems to have developed when visiting PEI!), and then we went out for a pre-dinner drink before meeting up with Malcolm at the Pilot House for dinner. A great finish to our trip.</p>

<p>The next morning found us at the airport bright and early on our way home to Alberta after a very memorable and enjoyable visit to PEI. We’ll come back soon!</p>
