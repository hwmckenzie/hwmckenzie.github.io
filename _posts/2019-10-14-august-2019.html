<p>This month starts and ends with stories about dogs, so I guess August was the "dog days of summer"... although who am I kidding, every day is "dog day" at the property!</p>

<p>Like many good friends, although Revi and Sadie have had their differences (hopefully past tense!), they enjoy many of the same activities and can often be found hanging out together. Here they are pursuing one of their favorite pastimes: digging!</p>

<p>In an effort to further our integration into the community, we attended the first annual Innisfree Bread Oven Pizza Night. Sadly, we are still quite new to the fire department and don't know many people in town yet. In an effort to know at least one person, we invited our new neighbors, but they didn't come, and so no one sat with us! The pizza was cooked in an outdoor oven and was very tasty... but considering we accidentally made a $20 donation to the town through a mix-up in payment, it turned out to be an expensive night out! Speaking of the fire department, we continue to enjoy going to practice and have gone on two more calls where we assisted with traffic control, as well as working a shift running the bar at a local wedding.</p>

<p>Fast on the heels of the pizza night, we put on our fancy dress and attended Feast on the Farm, a fundraising event hosted by Lakeland College in nearby Vermilion. The major beneficiary of the evening was the Student Managed Farm (powered by New Holland). Based on how many times they reminded us that it was "powered by New Holland", I think New Holland must have contributed quite a bit to the farm! It was a nice evening with tasty food, and it was fun to get dressed up, but we both wished it had included a tour of the farm or more presentations about the activities of the farm.</p>

<p>Mid-month Revi disgraced herself totally by running away, getting sprayed by a skunk (for the second time this summer for those who are counting!), and running into the neighbour's horse pasture on her way home. Luckily she was wearing her Tractive, so we were able to anticipate her plans to visit the horses and intercept her. By the time we pulled up in the van to retrieve her, she was already on her way back to the road and the horses were all standing unconcerned watching her go. We hustled her into the van and quickly headed back home, hopefully leaving our neighbours none the wiser to Revi's invasion. It was when we got her into the van that we became aware of her earlier skunk encounter. Based on our research the last time she was sprayed, we already had the suggested hydrogen peroxide on hand to combat the skunk odour. She still required two baths and many days later she still emits "eau de skunk", particularly when she gets wet.</p>

<p>August brought both happy and sad news for our birds. First, the sad. At the beginning of the month Chris and I both noticed what we think was an "unaccompanied minor" hummingbird. I first noticed it trying to drink out of the feeder, but it was woefully confused about where to put its beak to get the nectar, poking every part of the feeder but the holes. Later that day Chris saw it perched on our fence, and then later low in the grass. Sadly by the end of the day we found it dead in the grass. On a more joyful note, we had many humming birds visit our feeder who seemed to be thriving. Chris got some amazing video of them at one of our feeders, in which you can also see some of our red runner beans!</p>

<p>The pine siskins also arrived in droves and spent the month harassing each other, the chickadees, nuthatches, and any other birds who might have planned to dine at our feeders. They very much enjoyed the bird bath. As evidenced by the photos Chris got through the binoculars, they do not give much consideration to personal space!</p>

<p>Near the end of the month we harvested our vegetable "garden", which this summer consisted solely of several small plantings of potatoes. This included two potato bags, one potato box, and one area in a flower garden where we planted the extra seed potatoes that didn't fit into the bags or the box. So far we have only harvested the bags, and the results are underwhelming! By optimistic estimation, we harvested about double the number of seed potatoes we planted. Therefore, I don't expect our output to lead to great financial savings or to stave off hunger in the case of a famine. Perhaps we can increase production next summer... To that end, Chris has negotiated a deal with a cafe in Vermilion to collect all of their kitchen waste. To prepare for the increase in compostables, we constructed our first compost barrel this month, and have plans for a whole compost barrel farm. As we haven't taken any photos yet, and we expect the compost project to ramp up in September, I'll write about our composting next month.</p>

<p>In other plant news, one of the fields we walk by regularly was planted with flax this year, so we have been enjoying watching it transform into an ocean of blue flowers.</p>

<p>Closer to home, the mixed wild flower seeds Sandy gave us at Christmas have bloomed well beyond expectation and are making for a very cheery display out the kitchen window.</p>

<p>This month we knocked another item off our summer bucket list, which was to camp on our property. In a test run, Chris set up the tent outside our kitchen window as we wanted to be sure the dogs would manage without incident when left alone for the night. It was only moderately successful as it turned out we were on a bit of a slant, the death knell of many a good nights sleep in a tent! Sadly that was our only night spent in the tent this summer, so we didn't really knock this bucket list item out of the park. Much like the potatoes, better luck next year!</p>

<p>As promised, a few more dog tales to round out the report this month. Following one of her solo adventures, Tammi coughed on and off for about two weeks before producing a grass seed that must have been about 3 inches long, and appeared to have partially germinated in her throat! How the dogs traverse the fields at this time of year I have no idea as the crops are so tall, definitely over their heads, and the canola in particular is very dense. Tammi and Sadie have also started taking Cartrophen, which is supposed to help with any arthritis or joint pain. We do notice a difference in Tammi, and she seems to be running away more on her walks which suggests she is feeling spry, though we're not sure about Sadie. </p>

<p>Not to miss his chance to be in the blog, Seuss assisted us with the planting of a new row of lodgepole pines. I suspect he was more concerned with trying to grow more toys than trees!</p>

<p>To wrap up the month, and in honor of our upcoming first anniversary on September 8, we put up one of the wedding signs made by Heather. Here's to many more great years together on our property!</p>

<p><b><i>August’s recipe recommendations</b></i><br>
In August I got serious about meal planning and trying to eat more pulses. My main take-away is that other than red lentils, all pulses should be cooked in advance unless you want to eat at 9pm! The first recipe suggestion is very unique as pulse recipes go and I would highly recommend it. I also made a lot of slow cooker recipes as the summer is fading fast, so who wants to spend it slaving over a hot stove? ... unless it is for cookies (see last bullet)!!!
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.onegreenplanet.org/vegan-recipe/lemony-balsamic-split-pea-and-mushroom-risotto/"><u>Split pea and mushroom “risotto"</u></a>. The grains in this dish are replaced by split green peas. Surprisingly tasty with a nice smokey taste which was due in (a small) part to the addition of balsamic vinegar, and in (a larger) part to some distracted cooking by the chef!.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/recipes/a53050/slow-cooker-paella-recipe/"><u>Slow cooker paella</u></a>. Easy and tasty. Nothing to complain about here!.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thewholesomedish.com/crock-pot-beef-stroganoff/"><u>Slow cooker beef stroganoff</u></a>. This is one of my most enjoyed beef stroganoff slow cooker attempts to date!.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.livewellbakeoften.com/soft-chewy-oatmeal-chocolate-chip-cookies/"><u>Chocolate chip oatmeal cookies</u></a> (with apricots). I made A LOT of these this month. We really enjoyed the addition of the apricots. Chilling the dough is key to obtain good cookie morphology..</li>
