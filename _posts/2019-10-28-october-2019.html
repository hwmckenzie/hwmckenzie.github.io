<p>We kicked off October with a trip to PEI for the family gathering, which you can read all about starting with the <a href="https://hwmckenzie.github.io/2019/10/04/pei2019-1.html"><u>first post</u></a>. It was a wonderful trip and allowed us to enjoy a few more days of warm temperatures, sunshine, and ocean breezes.</p>

<p>Upon our return, we got to work preparing the property for the winter. This included, but was probably not limited to: putting away the rain barrels, cleaning our big rain water tank, putting up fencing around our larches (keep away rabbits!), scooting our trees (actually this was completed by Chris in November while Hannah was hiking around Patagonia!), harvesting the last of the potatoes (final tally was 7.8 lbs, not enough to last the winter that’s for sure!), spreading straw to minimize how much mud the dogs bring into the house in the fall and spring, removing and storing window screens, inspecting the septic tank (it's still there!), and general tidying in the yard (which is done on repeat!).</p> 

<p>At the end of the month we tried out our new .22, gifted to us by Ron. While this may eventually be used to convince our pigeons that the barn is not the peaceful refuge they believe it to be, we are currently starting slowly by instilling fear in our tin can population.</p>

<h5>Octobers's recipe recommendations</h5>
Not many suggestions from this month, but these two were popular and I can confidently say I’d make them again.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/potato-bean-stew/14488/"><u>Potato bean stew</u></a>. Easy, tasty, and hearty. I added some chipotle peppers in sauce (they come in a can), which gave this a nice smokey flavour.</li>
<li><a href="https://minimalistbaker.com/lentil-eggplant-lasagna/"><u>Lentil and eggplant lasagna</u></a>. This one does take some time and assembly, but it is tasty so worth the effort for a special occasion.</li>
</ul>
