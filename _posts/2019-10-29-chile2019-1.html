<b><i>October 29</i></b>

<p>I am sitting in a hotel lobby in Calgary at the start of an unexpected great adventure!</p>

<p>As some will know and others will not, I was invited to join Working Dogs for Conservation (WD4C) as an orienteer and handler on a project to detect pumas in Patagonia, Chile. I have been trying to get more experience with WD4C since almost the first day I was partnered up with Seuss. I never imagined when my chance came it would be in another hemisphere!</p>

<p>Since I found out about the trip in August I have been completing daily Spanish audio lessons in an effort to remember and improve what I learned in my high school language classes. Diligently repeating basic phrases to my surroundings and wondering how it will all translate to immersion in the real world. I did visit Cuba years ago, but that time I had the benefit of being with Lea, who is a most excellent Spanish speaker and overall travel companion. She will be sorely missed on this trip! However, I won’t be bereft of travel companions, as in addition to the WD4C team, the Panthera project team, and another dog team from Costa Rica, Chris will be joining me just over a week after I arrive.</p> 

<p>Stay tuned to the blog for posts about Zoey (the dog I’ll be working with), Panthera and what the puma research is all about, Torres del Paine (the national park where we are working), where we are staying, the food we are eating, and most importantly, if I am managing to swim in the deep end of the Spanish language pool!</p>
