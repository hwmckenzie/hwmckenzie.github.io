<h5>October 31</h5>
 
<p>I am indeed (very) slowly making my way through Bruce Chatwin’s iconic book, In Patagonia, describing his travels through the land. But, more importantly, I myself am now in Patagonia after a mostly, but not entirely, smooth trip from the northern hemisphere.</p>

<p>My journey began in Calgary and was very smooth and easy through Chicago and on to Miami. Unfortunately Megan, who was escorting Zoey the dog from her home in Missoula to Miami, did not fare so well. Zoey, or rather her crate, was not cleared by United for travel. So poor Megan, who learned of this at 3am at the airport check-in counter, had to arrange to get new flights booked and then run out to several pet stores in search of an approved crate.</p> 

<p>Once in Miami, unexpectedly solo, I navigated the steps of picking up the rental car and getting myself to the hotel. Being mentally prepared for the spring weather and wind of Patagonia, I was shocked to arrive in a hot and humid Miami. Upon arriving at the hotel I locked the door, had a shower, ate my airport sandwich, and went to bed!</p>

<p>The next morning I met Megan at the airport and together we went to rescue poor Zoey from cargo. With most of the day to burn until our flight to Santiago, we headed to Bill Bags Cape Florida State Park at the end of Key Biscayne. We went to the beach and saw the lighthouse. Then we took a short walk on a wooded trail, but quickly retreated to the car and the A/C, as we were all wilting!</p>

<p>After much navigation of Miami traffic (successfully, I flatter myself!) we found some very tasty ahi wraps and smoothies and took them to the waterfront to eat in what breeze we could find. Too soon, we were headed back to the airport to get Zoey checked in, which involved a lot of waiting around. One last memorable final walk with Zoey in the hot humid darkness on a small patch of grass outside the airport and we all headed to the plane.</p>

<p>Once airborne, dinner and one glass of wine later, I was sound asleep, only to awaken to the smell of breakfast and the sights of mountains!</p>

<p>I had some coffee, which was lucky as it turned out that I required fortification for what was to come next!</p>

<p>After disembarking the plane and making it through immigration, I found my bags and then was left with the task of finding Zoey. After a long wait I did finally find her after enlisting one of the LATAM people to make a phone call. She came out on the baggage carousel and lots of people helped me lift her down and into the cart. Many muchas gracias later, we proceeded to customs, where we hit a small snag with Zoey’s vaccinations. Long story short, she was healthy but didn’t meet the Chilean requirements. After much bad Spanish (on my part), better English (on the part of the customs officer), and Google translate, we spoke to a vet who said he would come to the airport to vaccinate her. He arrived, administered the shot, and after some sweating on our part, we even made our final connection with only a few extra grey hairs!</p>

<p>We arrived in Punta Arenas to have Steve and Stefanny waiting for us with the van. A final three hours of driving and we were installed in our teeny tiny cabana in Puerto Natales. Though the drive was long, the scenery along the drive was spectacular, and we even got to see flamingoes at a distance. They looked like a group of large orange-pinkish buoys bobbing on the water!</p>

<p>We went out immediately for dinner and wine to this very neat restaurant made out of shipping containers. I enjoyed a traditional Chilean seafood stew dish that was full of local seafood and very tasty. We also saw lots of people out trick or treating which was neat.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I slept very well after all of that!</p>
