<b><i>November 1-2</i></b>

<p>My first two full days in Patagonia! And very full they were. Full of waiting, coffee drinking (while waiting), driving, driving (repeat intended!), and enough little challenges to keep us all on our toes! By the end we were all chomping at the bit to get out and start doing what we can here to do: find puma poop! But, for the record, here is the story of our first two days.</p>

<p>Stephanny (the other dog handler from Costa Rica) and I joined Megan (WD4C trainer) and her boyfriend/orienteer Steve for breakfast at their hostel. This consisted of toast, cheese, and meat, along with yogurt and nescafe. Not feeling entirely sustained, we searched a bit and found some “real” coffee. Then we hit the grocery store to get a few items to hold us over until a bigger shop the next day once we had all moved into two larger cabanas next door to the teeney tiny cabana. The grocery store was pretty exciting. It is much more challenging to shop when you don’t recognize what things are and only vaguely how much they cost! Most things here have lots of sugar, sweetener, or salt. There was no plain unsweetened yogurt in sight!</p>

<p>After the grocery store we all returned to the teeney tiny cabana to wait for Omar, one of the Panthera researchers. This might be a good time to take a few minutes to explain who Panthera is and what we are doing here... and we have a bit of time as Omar was much longer in arriving than expected!</p>

<p>Panthera is an organization devoted to conserving the world’s forty wild cat species and the ecosystems on which they depend. We are contributing to their project to study pumas in and around Torres del Paine national park here in Chile. Pumas range throughout the Americas and though they go by many names including cougar, mountain lion, catamount, and panther, they are all the same cat. The status of the puma population in Chile is largely unknown, and pumas face threats from illegal killing, human-puma conflict, and loss of prey and habit. Mark (Panthera’s puma program lead) and Omar are currently working to try to estimate the puma population in the park. They have an array of cameras (80!) set up, and we are working with the dogs to collect scat which will be analyzed using genetics to  identify the individual pumas. Both of these methods will produce population estimates, which will hopefully be similar!</p> 

<p>Omar arrived after lunch and we finally set off to meet the park rangers, see where we would be working for the next month, and the estancia (ranch) Goic where we will be living for the second half. It is a long drive to the park, almost 2 hours, and the roads are not very good. We soon found this out the hard way when our van got a flat tire! We set about changing it and soon found we were missing the critical tool that lets you lower the spare tire from under the vehicle. We did manage to find it after much searching, hidden in a secret compartment under the front seat, nowhere near the rest of the tools! Quite lucky as our rescuer was expecting to arrive by 9pm!</p>

<p>With our van back operating on all four tires, we arrived at the park office and had a quick meeting with the head ranger and park manager. Although I wasn’t able to follow it all (Stefanny is our Spanish speaker), I could understand that they are very passionate about puma conservation, and that just like tourists in Canada, visitors here are not very good about following the rules. They are very concerned that because of people’s behaviour and single-minded focus on getting photographs of the pumas, someone is going to get injured and the puma will take the blame. They told us that just five minutes before a puma had walked right past the office! Turns out she was still in the area and while leaving the parking lot we were lucky enough to get our first glimpse of a puma! I was not able to get a photo, but hopefully we have a chance to see more while we are here.</p>

<p>After our meeting we headed out to let Tigre, Steffany’s dog, have a go at finding some puma scat. Zoey, the dog I am working with, has been trained on cougar scat from Washington and needs to get acquainted with the scent of local puma scat, so we need Tigre to find some for us.</p>

<p>Tigre had no luck finding puma scat this time and soon it was time to go to the estancia Goic to meet Mark. At this point it was already 7pm, so it was looking like a late night, but the drive was very beautiful.</p>

<p>Dinner at the ranch was very tasty. Hopefully we can eat there a lot while we are staying as a hot meal will be very nice after a day hiking in the field. We also learned that the cabin we will be staying in at Goic has some quirks. Mainly that the water is heated by a wood stove, so the first thing you do right when you get home is to start a fire so you can have a hot shower!</p>

<p>At 9pm we started the long drive home, after Juan, the owner of Goic, kindly pumped up our tires which seemed a little flat. We went home by a different route which was all paved, but unfortunately also had a police check stop! Everything seemed to be ok until they told us that in Chile you need a special license to drive a van. They let us continue home, but they wrote down Megan’s license and Steffany told us that we would be in big trouble if they stopped us again. At the time we were quite concerned as we weren’t sure how to get a different vehicle. But, it all turned out to be ok as the next day Adolfo (the guy renting the van to us) told us we had a special paper from the ministry of transportation stating that a special license was only needed for the van if it was being used as a commercial vehicle with more than 10 passengers. Phew! Upon arriving home at 11pm we collapsed into bed.</p>

<p>Poor Zoey has only gotten short walks so far, and things weren’t looking good for her in the near future as we planned to spend the next day getting the tire fixed, moving to two larger cabanas next door, and doing a full grocery shop.</p> 

<p>The next day things continued in the same way as Steffany and I got the van stuck trying to go to town to meet Megan and Steve to do groceries. The water table is very high here and the ground is saturated. It seems the tires on the van weren’t up to the task (though perhaps we did park poorly the night before, but in our defence it was very late!). After much unsuccessful effort on our part, the husband of the family we were renting from returned from his morning jog and was able to help us. In the end it took his whole family pushing and him prying our front wheel with a big pole to get us unstuck. A little more of a workout than his regular jog I expect! Good thing I brought some maple syrup and candies for exactly this sort of moment!</p>

<p>After all of this, by 11am we joined Meg and Steve at this neat place called Nandu to revive ourselves with a second breakfast and coffee. Our total sum of accomplishments for the day consisted of getting the van stuck and then unstuck! However, I soon enjoyed the big success of getting a SIM card so I am now the proud owner of a Chilean number and 1GB of data!</p>

<p>Now we are waiting for our new cabanas to be ready so we can move. Then we will eat dinner, drink some pisco sours and go to bed early so we can catch up on our sleep. We plan to start working the dogs tomorrow, for which they will be very grateful as so far they have been mostly stuck in their kennels except for very quick walks. One of the reasons their walks are quick is the large number of ownerless dogs that roam around. As this post is already very long, I’ll tackle that topic in another post.</p>

<p>I am starting to realize that things you take for granted at home take longer when you are trying to work in a new and very different country. Everything is just harder and more complicated. But I feel like the tide is turning for us and we will soon be on our way to smoother sailing.</p>
