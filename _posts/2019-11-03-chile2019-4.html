<h5>November 3</h5>

<p>With everyone settled into their new cabanas and a full supply of groceries to see us through the next few days, we headed out bright and early this morning to finally get down to work. The view on our commute was enviable!</p>

<p>We started by leaving Zoey in the van and all the humans followed Tigre, the experienced puma scat dog from Costa Rica. With Tigre in the lead, we were soon finding lots of puma scats. Or at least they were some sort of wild cat scat. Tigre is trained on the six species of wild cats they have in Costa Rica, so you could say he is very attuned to the feline scent. Stephanny thought the scats looked quite small for puma, so some of them are quite likely from Geoffroy’s cat, a wild cat about the size of a house cat that lives in much of South America, though not much is known about the population in Torres del Paine. We also saw what we think are fox scats (the park is home to the southern grey fox and the red fox). These are sometimes recognizable as they contain lots of insects.</p>

<p>The vistas were amazing even though it was overcast with gale force winds for most of the day and the tops of the mountains stayed hidden in cloud.</p>

<p>Despite the howling wind, there are many different kinds of wildflowers here. Not surprisingly, most have growth forms low to the ground!</p>

<p>Once we had a good supply of scats to train Zoey with, Meg and I returned to the van to get Zoey up to speed. She was trained at home before coming using cougar scats from Washington, so we needed to help her make the leap to the local pumas of Patagonia. Needless to say she was very happy to get out and run around after almost a week of traveling and patiently waiting for her turn to work. With all the excitement of a new place with new smells, Zoey was only partly thinking about her job. So, though we made some progress today, we still have some work to do before we can go out on real searches. Tigre on the other hand put in a solid day’s work and found 30+ scats!</p>
