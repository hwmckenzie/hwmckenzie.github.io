<h5>November 4-5</h5>

<p>We have now worked three days and Zoey is a pro at finding puma scat. She is also a pro at staring off into the distance in search of guanacos, which is likely to keep me on my toes when I take over from Megan as the handler! In all fairness to Zoey, guanacos are very curious and seem to enjoy following us around and calling to us, which sounds quite similar to a horse’s neigh.</p>

<p>On our second day of work (Nov 4) we again started out by following Tigre and marking where he found scat. The route started out nicely along a gravel road, so it was perfect for Zoey to learn on. Once we had a few known scats, Tigre continued on and we got Zoey out to have her turn. She quickly showed us that she knows what’s going on, and that she finds it much easier to concentrate on a road where she can’t see the view (or the guanacos watching us) for miles and miles in all directions! We deviated off the dirt road a few times and peeked down into a beautiful river valley.</p>

<p>Unfortunately due to a miscommunication with Omar and Mark we were accidentally working on some private land where we didn’t have permission. The owner came upon Tigre, Stephanny, and Steve, so after they were asked to leave they came to pick us up. Oops!</p>

<p>Working with dogs seems to be a little controversial here. Many ranches neighbouring the park make money by taking tourists to see the pumas and they don’t want their money-makers scared away by dogs. Even though the dogs work very close to us and would never (or never be allowed!) to chase wildlife, the belief persists that having dogs around would mean the pumas would disappear for weeks.</p> 

<p>In the afternoon we moved to a new grid block where Zoey really came into her own and found many scats. We also ran into some wild horses who were not very happy to see us! They approached at speed with obvious ill intent, so Megan retreated with Zoey (who seemed interested in going to visit the horses and to tell them a few things herself!) and I tried to look big and head them off. There were a few moments where I wasn’t sure if they would stop, but after much yelling on my part they finally decided they had better things to do then stampede a strange arm-flapping human. Once they left we hightailed it out of there!</p>

<p>On the last day of our three day shift (Nov 5), we woke up to rain and wind. But, as intrepid field biologists, we headed out in search of scats despite the weather. We should have listened to our guts and stayed in bed! We struggled through howling wind and horizontal rain to complete the transect of our grid. Partway through my phone battery died and we had to fall back on our GPS which didn’t display our transect or the terrain. A little while later, while waiting for my “quick-dry” pants to dry (surely under such windy conditions!), I realized the futility of this hope as the wind was actually just high velocity water droplets! When the battery on Zoey’s collar also died, Meg, Zoey and I admitted defeat and retreated soaked and shivering. Upon cresting the final hill I was very happy to see the van was where I thought it was! We found Steve, Tigre and  Stephanny already huddled inside with the heat blasting. Stephanny’s only comment was “no es buena!”. So, due to the weather, the only photo I have from the day is at the restaurant later that night!</p>
