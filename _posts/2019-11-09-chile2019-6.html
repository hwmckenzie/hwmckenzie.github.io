<h5>November 7-9</h5>

<p>We headed back to work after a relaxing day off (Nov 6), which also gave us a much needed chance to dry out all of our clothes following the wet weather on the previous day. We have also been diligently drying out all of the scat samples using desiccant beads. These start out orange and change colour to white when they have absorbed all the water they can. It is important to dry out the samples so they don’t grow mould before getting to the lab that will extract the puma DNA. So, many nights find us tending to our poop samples!</p>

<p>The first day of our shift (Nov 7) was challenging for Zoey as she was featuring in her own show on what I like to call “Guanaco TV”. I think we must be the most interesting thing to watch in these parts, and so the guanacos seem to follow us at a distance watching us as we work. This is too much for poor Zoey! Halfway through the day I think Megan had had enough of trying to keep Zoey on task and handed over the leash to me. I was definitely ready, as Megan has to make sure to get me trained up so Zoey and I can continue when she leaves in a few days. (Note that as a result of the switchover, the amount of photos will be reduced until Chris arrives!)</p>

<p>I’m not sure if we just moved to a less distracting area, if it was just a fresh face, or if whatever I was doing just worked for Zoey in that moment, but we got back on track and finished the day strong. I was pretty excited to be working with Zoey. I have been hoping and working to join one of WD4C’s projects handling a dog for a while now, so it was pretty neat to realize that goal.</p>

<p>Day two of our partnership (Nov 8) found us working out the kinks. Zoey holds her cards close to her chest and likes to keep me guessing a bit about whether she has found puma scat or just something of personal interest to her. We worked through a beautiful area and ended up down on a rocky beach with big waves crashing from the lake. With the wind here the lakes seem more like oceans. Zoey loves the waves. She ran back and forth and in and out chasing them. We stopped for lunch and of course Zoey was shivering because she was wet and has no extra fat on her on account of all the running she does. So we fed her some cheese to warm her up! In the afternoon we met a park ranger and I got to use my Spanish to explain what we were doing and that we had a permit and permission from the park “jefe” or “chief”. I’m sure it wasn’t entirely correct, but he got the gist and seemed happy to let us continue. The scenery continues to deliver. Here is Zoey admiring one of the great views from today.</p>

<p>The final day of our shift (Nov 9) saw Zoey, myself, Steve, and Megan all head out together. Steve got to come with us today as Tigre had been throwing up all night so Stephanny gave him the day off. She suspects he ate some dead guanaco... Typical Labrador! It was a spectacular day. All of the peaks were visible under bright blue skies and there was no wind so the lakes were like glass.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Zoey and I it was also a very challenging day as we were working in an area frequented by bunnies! My task for the day was the learn to tell the difference between what Zoey looks like when she is searching for puma poop compared to what she’s looks like when she is tracking bunnies... and to encourage the former and discourage the latter! The area was also a sort of flat along a river with very soft grass. Most of the vegetation here is very prickly, so Zoey took full advantage of the excellent footing to demonstrate how just fast she could run. Despite our challenges we still found lots (and some of the biggest!) puma poop, so we are achieving our goal. I think this poop was left as a message: stay out of my territory!</p>

<p>All returned home happy and looking forward to a day off. For myself I was extra excited as Chris was arriving that night!</p>
