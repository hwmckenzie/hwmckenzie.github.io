<h5>November 10-14</h5>

<p>Chris arrived on the bus today (Nov 9)! Meg, Steve, and I spent the day searching (best weather we have had yet!) and then picked Chris up from the bus station before heading to dinner. I think after all his travels Chris might have preferred to head directly to bed, but he rallied and we enjoyed a tasty dinner and the last night with Megan and Steve. After that we returned to our cabana, put the mattress from the top bunk on the floor, and promptly fell asleep.</p>

<p>The next day we enjoyed some breakfast and relaxing in Puerto Natales, said goodbye to Meg and Steve, did groceries, picked up our new team member Pierre, and then headed out to our new accommodation at Estancia Laguna Amarga, which is a ranch right on the edge of the park. Pierre is a local Chilean who will be working as an orienteer for Stephanny. Our new home is a cosy (read: small!) two bedroom cabin with a wood stove that also heats the water for our showers! The view really can't be beat though.</p>

<p>The story of the estancia (as far as I have gathered) is an interesting one. The Goic family who owns the estancia used to be primarily sheep ranchers. But sheep are very susceptible to predation by pumas, and so as a sheep rancher you have a lot of conflict with pumas. Pierre told us that a puma can kill up to 30 sheep in one night, though they prefer guanaco. Although it is illegal to kill pumas, many are still killed to protect livestock. At some point, the Goic family decided to reduce their sheep ranch and switch over to tourism. So now they have a restaurant, a hotel, and camping, in addition to taking tourists on tours to view and photograph the pumas. They must do well as things are certainly over-priced! We were planning to eat some dinners in the restaurant, but have decided against it as it is quite pricey and not worth it. And while our little cabana is affordable, I think a bed in the hostel can be pretty pricey as well.</p>

<p>During the first three days working with Chris we had spectacular weather. We got to see all the peaks (yay!), and Chris even got a sunburn (boo). It is so nice having Chris here and getting to hike around with him all day. His job is to be my orienteer (read: tell me where to go to make sure I follow our route!) and to pick up any puma scat that Zoey finds that we estimate to be fresh enough for DNA analysis. He is the best looking orienteer in my opinion! And also now I am getting way more photos!</p>

<p>Our first day (Nov 11) was a bit challenging. First of all, it was my first day without the support of a trainer (eek!), so I was feeling a bit uncertain. Our route was along a hiking trail and we somehow ended up leapfrogging with a large group of students who were out for a hike. The terrain was also difficult as we were working in an area affected by a forest fire, so there were a lot of burned, but still standing, trees to navigate around and over. And Zoey was very distracted by working along the nice lake and only wanted to go downhill to the water in the afternoon, even though Chris kept encouraging us to go in the uphill direction! Despite this, she did find a really neat lattrine in a tree that was used by a small wild cat. Challenges notwithstanding, everyone was still smiling at the end of the day!</p>

<p>Our second day (Nov 12) went much more smoothly as the terrain was more similar to what I had experienced while working with Megan. We only had one little hiccup in that we forgot to take extra sample jars. However, Chris modified our route so that we looped back close-ish the van, and then Zoey and I got to sit on a rock and relax while he hoofed it back to the van for more jars so we could finish our route! What a guy!</p>

<p>On our last day of the three-day shift (November 13) we worked in a relatively flat area full of wetlands and many birds. We saw flamingoes at a distance... and also some guanacos, of course! On the way home we stopped at the Cascada del Paine (waterfalls) for some photos.</p>

<p>All those days of hiking earned us a day off in Puerto Natales. Which, though it is enticing as it has a lot of tasty food and faster internet, it is also a 1.5 hour drive on very bumpy and windy roads! You also pass very close to a border crossing into Argentina, which is pretty quiet. I don't think they are expecting a lot of people to cross there.</p>

<p>It ended up that Chris and I went to town while Pierre and Stephanny decided to stay at the estancia. I had a bit of shopping to do as I had lost part of the sole on one of my hiking shoes and also ripped my shirt! We got the groceries and then enjoyed some coffee and lunch before making the trek back for our next two days of work.</p>
