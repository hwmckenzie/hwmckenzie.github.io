<h5>November 15-17</h5>

<p>Our first day after the day off (Nov 15) was truly spectacular. The weather was "moody", with fog drifting around all the peaks. We were working along Lago Nordenskjold, which gave us a great view of many of the really big peaks and we were treated to amazing and changing views throughout the day, as well as regular rumbles as ice calved off the glaciers of the peaks. We have been trying to be relatively inconspicuous in the park. Dogs are not allowed and so many tourists complain when they see us as they do not realize we are working. However, I think we blew our cover at the end of this day as we had to descend a big scree and shrub slope located right in front of a big parking lot full of people who had stopped to admire the view!</p>

<p>The next day (Nov 16) we woke up to a beautiful rainbow arcing over our mountain view! We split a route with Stephanny and Tigre in the morning due to the logistics of starting points and only having one vehicle. Neither team had a very good time of it as the terrain was very challenging and the vegetation was extremely thorny, which made it difficult for the dogs. With the humans feeling a bit downcast, we chose an easier route in the afternoon that started near one of the park gates. There we met a ranger who was very interested in the dogs and what we were doing, and came to stand with us outside as we got ready to fend off complaints from concerned tourists about the dogs. Chris and I saw puma prints in the sand on this route and Zoey found one of the freshest scats we have seen yet. Surely they will be able to get DNA from that one!</p>

<p> we finished the search at the park gate, we decided to drive to Puerto Natales to enjoy some dinner and get gas and groceries so that everyone could enjoy a day off without driving. Although it was nice to just laze around the estancia for the whole day (Nov 17), by the end of it, Chris, Zoey, and I were all going a bit crazy! Our stir-craziness (at least on the part of the humans) was also due to the fact that the internet, always a little slow, had ground to a halt! We couldn't even get reception at the special internet spot! Everyone was ready to get back to searching.</p>
