<b><i>November 18-24</i></b>

<p>It is hard to believe the days we have left here are numbered, but we are counting them down to make sure we get everything done that we need to before it is time to head home. We had originally planned another three day shift, but the weather was not on our side.</p>

<p>On the first day (Nov 18), Chris, Zoey, and I had a very odd, broken up route to do. It ended up being along a road and also through an area with many nesting birds. As a consequence Zoey worked on leash all day, and we also got “yelled" at by quite a few upset birds (though we did our best to avoid them). At one point Chris and I looked over to see a large goose flattened in the grass on her nest only a few feet away. Zoey missed her entirely! Luckily for us, we were quite quick to finish our route, so when the rain started just after lunch we were almost back to the vehicle. Stephanny, Tigre, and Pierre were less lucky. They had encountered a large creek and had to spend quite a bit of time searching for a way across it. As a consequence, they were quite wet by the time they finished. But, the rain came with a bright silver lining as we saw a puma on the drive home! She/he ran across the road in front of us, heading to a small pond for a drink. We stopped to try to take a photo, but the puma was quite shy and disappeared behind a small bush. Even though we didn’t get a photo, seeing the puma was really special.</p>

<p>The rain continued all night, and was still going strong in the morning (Nov 19). Based on our previous experience working in the wind and rain, we decided to re-arrange our plans, and instead decided to go to Puerto Natales to take Zoey to the vet so she could get a clean bill of health which is needed for her to re-enter the United States. Unfortunately the rain also affected this plan, as we go our van stuck trying to get up the hill from our cabana to the road! Luckily, Pierre enlisted the assistance of the owner Juan to pull us out. And when he wasn't able to pull us out with his truck, he used something with a little more traction!</p>

<p>The next day (Nov 20) found us hiking again. Today we got to follow a trail that climbed steeply up and then followed a ridge before descending again to the road. It was very scenic and nice to have a trail for a change. As it was a one-way route, Stephanny and Pierre dropped us off at one and end we walked to a pick-point at the other end. As we were starting, two of the head park managers came upon us. I did my best to talk with them in Spanish, but being caught off guard it wasn’t my best performance! I offered to take their photo with Zoey, which they liked, and then I introduced Chris by saying “Soy Chris” and pointing to him… which was likely confusing for them as it means "I am Chris"!</p>

<p>Our route for today (Nov 21) was back in the area where we first started while Steve and Meg were here... however, now coming from the estancia instead of Puerto Natales, we made a tactical error in our choice of route to get there... and ended up doing three hours of unnecessary driving! The route started at a park gate that was on the property of the Estancia Lazo, so we drove through someone's yard, through the park gate, and then we were off! After all the driving it was a relief to be hiking, though that feeling wore off quickly as it was a very steep uphill climb!  Admittedly picturesque though, which I observed frequently while taking a break to catch my breath and check with Chris about which direction we should head in, to which the answer was always unvariably: up. After lunch we descended into a very neat and different forest with big trees, streams, and Austral parakeets! The last bit of the day was walking along a trail beside the lake, so a good finish to what was a challenging start. Needless to say we took a better route on the drive home and arrived in about 30 minutes! As a bonus, we also spotted a fox on the way home. A rare sighting indeed!</p>

<p>The next day (Nov 22) we headed to a new area we had not been to before near Lago Grey. When Stephanny went to talk to the rangers to let them know we would be working there, they had some concerns. One of the rangers had been working in the area for 25 years to recover "el humel", an endangered deer. The species was just starting to recover in the Lago Grey area, and our timing was particularly bad as we were right in the middle of the spring baby season. Even though our dogs do not chase any animals, even just hiking through the area with a dog could disturb the deer during this sensitive time. So, finding ourselves with no sniffing to do, and at the head of a short hike, we left the dogs to relax in the van and headed out to see Lago Grey and the icebergs, and then enjoyed lunch at the visitor's center. A tough day at the office!</p>

<p>Hard to believe, but today (Nov 23) was our last day hiking with Zoey. Our route started right at the park entrance within sight of our little cabana at the estancia. Zoey had a very difficult start to her day as almost as soon as we began we came across two fighting guanacos. Being mating season, these two were very committed to their battle. Unlike the cervids I have encountered before who resolve their differences by butting heads, guanacos take a different approach. They chase each other around trying to get in behind and bite off the family jewels, or at least so our local Chilean Pierre told us! This involves a lot of very fast running up and down steep terrain, all while doing a lot of vocalization. It was all a bit much for poor Zoey who, unable to chase after them as her little heart desired, did quite a bit of vocalization herself! I'm not really sure if she ever fully recovered enough to focus on finding puma scat, but we did manage to find a few at least, and finish our route for the day. We waited for Stephanny and Pierre to pick us up at the park gate, so got a chance to watch the tourist buses come and go. We were also a captive audience for a very chatty park ranger. He was older man with many years experience working at the park, who no doubt would have been very interesting to talk to... if only my spanish was better! As it was I think I understood about 10% of what he was saying, and he said quite a lot over the 45 minutes he talked to us! I think he did realize that we weren't really quite following the strand of the conversation, but he didn't seem to mind and just kept right on going!</p>

<p>We spend our last day at the estancia (Nov 24) packing to go home. This included getting all of the scat organized. Zoey also had some well-deserved play time with her ball and new best friend Chris. It was nice to just relax and play with her for fun instead of while working. Although most things were in order, I did suffer a bit of stress about Zoey's health certificate. We needed it for the leg of her trip from Miami home to Montana, and the airline was not satisfied with the one we got in Puerto Natales because it was in Spanish. They also did not seem to be very willing to tell me what solution would work for them, short of me getting a new health certificate in English... quite unlikely on a Sunday at 5 pm when we were located at the estancia, a two hour drive from Puerto Natales where all the vets we had encountered so far seemed quite Spanish-speaking! Thankfully, Skye, the wonderful Director of Operations for Working Dogs for Conservation was checking her email on a Sunday, and weighed into my email conversation with the airline. She pulled no punches and quickly had them agreeing to my plan to have Zoey get a health certificate once we got to Miami. With this settled, Chris and I enjoyed a final pisco sour and went to bed.</p>
