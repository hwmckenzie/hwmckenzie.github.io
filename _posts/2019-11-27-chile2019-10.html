<h5>November 25-27</h5>

<p>We woke up on Monday morning (Nov 25) and began the multi-day trek that was our journey home. It began with a three hour drive in the rain to the airport in Punta Arenas. However, this also included a stop for a very tasty breakfast and coffee. Breakfast is good in Chile, I think because they are not shy with the butter! Once there, we hung out with Zoey for a long as we could before surrendering her to the cargo staff. Then we cleared security and went to watch as they loaded our plane. Luckily we saw her crate get loaded, so we knew she was on the plane with us!</p>

<p>When we landed in Santiago, I asked if we could see Zoey, and to my surprise they said yes! So, after rescuing her from cargo we wheeled her outside to where all the taxis were waiting, and let her out for a break on the very green grass of the Holiday Inn. We even had time to feed her, give her water, and some reassuring pets, before checking her back in. As Chris's flight was earlier than mine and Zoey's, he went on ahead while I checked Zoey back into cargo. Much to my surprise, Chris was waiting for me just past security to deliver a muffin, drink, and chocolate bar, before hurrying off to his gate!</p>

<p>The flight from Santiago to Miami went smoothly, and Zoey was waiting for me when I finally got through the long immigration line. We had a quick stop in customs to show our paperwork, and then a very long wait in the car rental line. Poor Zoey! Once we got the car, I stopped at the first patch of grass I could find to give her a much needed break. That taken care of, we checked in to our hotel and I got a very tasty breakfast and coffee from the hotel, which was complimentary from the guy at the front desk, I think because I was so nice and some guy looking for pool towels was very rude! Then Zoey and I just lay together for a while on the bed. Zoey staring out the window and me staring at the ceiling.</p>

<p>Once we came to, I enjoyed a very long, hot, shower in the very spacious and modern tile and glass shower room. This felt very deluxe after two weeks of showering "navy" style by turning off the water while lathering. Hot water conservation is a necessity when your hot water is heated over a wood stove! With me feeling more human, and hopefully Zoey feeling more like a dog, we set out to get the aforementioned health certificate. Skye had made an appointment for us at a vet clinic nearby, so we camped out in their waiting room until they had a chance to see us. I guess there were quite a few emergencies that day, and they were short a receptionist for a while. Zoey took all the waiting it in stride and by the end we finally had the piece of paper that would ensure she could make the final let of her journey home.</p>

<p>Wednesday morning Zoey and I got up very early to go for a quick walk before I took her to the cargo facility. Walking with her in the warm darkness reminded me quite a lot of our last walk together at the airport before we started this adventure. We drove the cargo facility and once the paperwork was all done, the moment came to leave her in her crate, waiting to be picked up and to start her very long day of travel home to Missoula. It was really hard! I was barely able to utter a quick "thanks" to the woman at the counter and get to the car before breaking down in tears! It is hard when you can't explain to your teammate what is happening as you send them off on an uncertain day of travel knowing you won't be there to make sure they are ok along the way.</p>

<p>With Zoey on her way, it was time for me to get to my flight. I returned the car and checked in. The only casualty was my sweater, which somehow got left on the luggage cart. All my flights went smoothly, and Chris was waiting for me with all the dogs fresh from the kennel when I arrived at the airport in Edmonton. I was of course very excited to see Seuss. The feeling was not mutual, or at least not entirely! While he may have been glad to have me home, he also wanted to make sure I was aware that leaving him home for a month while I went off on an adventure was not cool! He conveyed these feelings through growling and teeth baring, although by the time we got home to the property we were once again fast friends. Shortly after walking in the door, I got a message from Melissa to say that Zoey had also arrived home and was enjoying a tasty bone and was then headed for a warm bed. I felt pretty happy to be home and to know that Zoey was also home.</p>

<p>Thanks for a great adventure Zoe-Zoe!</p>
