<p>December was jam packed with activity, so we definitely finished off 2019 with a bang here at the property! As a quick overview of the long post below: we decorated, we baked, we took in some theater, Jess and Bailey came to visit, we ate, we puppy-sat, and we rested.</p>

<p>After getting our feet under us following our return from Chile, Chris and I quickly got the cabin ready for Christmas. We are old pros now at hanging our Christmas lights and Chris had them up in no time. I got busy in the kitchen doing some Christmas baking. For the last few years I have made little bags of Christmas cookies for the people we know here. This includes our vet, our postmaster, the guy who plows our driveway (though you have to be fast to get him his cookies!), and this year some of our new friends on the fire department. In a moment of exuberant festive cheer, I committed to making quite a few different varieties of baking, including individual mincemeat tarts. I realize I may have run out of steam near the end as I have memories of swearing up and down that I would only make two kinds of cookies next year and I would simplify the wrapping! Needless to say they were all very much appreciated and I'm sure by the time next year rolls around I will have completely forgotten the labor of love that was shaping dozens of tiny tarts or drawing trees on hand-made gift tags. Perhaps I should re-read this post in November next year in order to calibrate my Christmas aspirations!</p>

<p>Not to contain my creativity to the kitchen, I embarked upon a bold project to crochet a mini-stocking advent calendar for Chris. This vision was first imagined in Chile, but I was not able to get a start on it until the beginning of December. Needless to say, with calendar days already flying by, there was a production crunch. The first few were a bit rough, but after squinting through many viewings of the helpful video showing exactly how to turn the dreaded heel, stocking output (and quality!) increased. I was able to stuff them with treats and hang them in the office by about the end of the first week of December. I think they looked quite good!</p>

<p>Upon reflection, it seems that December was indeed quite a domestic month for me as I also reconnected with my very basic sewing skills thanks to Marlene's friend Ellen who sent me a small handheld sewing machine she found. Ellen was also the one who found my wedding dress at a garage sale, and she provided some homemade mincemeat for the tarts, so she is now 3 for 3! All of the hours laboring in the basement of the Ottawa house over the sewing machine with my mom in order to produce a project for home economics came flooding back and I managed to make an envelope pillow (which I googled how to do), even though the most dreaded happened partway through with the bobbin running out and needing to be rewound! I am excited to see what other projects I can tackle in the new year.</p>

<p>In preparation for the arrival of Jess and Bailey we did some work to transform the office shed into a dual purpose office/guest cabin. This included completing the remaining spackling and painting, putting up the last few pieces of molding, obtaining and assembling a twin bed from ikea (which we have later plans to ikea hack into a couch-by-day/bed-by-night number), sewing and hanging some DIY curtains (project #2 for the new sewing machine!), and generously applying weather stripping to any cracks of light entering through the door. With the finishing touches in place, Chris installed a fire detector and a fireplace, powered by a RaspberryPi and displayed on his computer monitor! It was such a cosy space by the end of it I had to stop myself from sleeping there instead of offering it to our guests! There are still a few remaining touches, which Chris sensibly talked me out of doing in the last hour or so before his sisters arrived, but hopefully those will be completed soon. Then we can confidently say we have a very private and cosy space for anyone who would like to visit. The facilities are, ahem, rustic, unless you are willing to walk to the house. But that is part of the charm of visiting the country after all, right?!</p>

<p>In the midst of all this Christmas bliss we got some bad news about our well. The coliforms are back. Twenty-four of them in 100 mL to be precise, which is 24 too many according to Alberta Health. Coliforms come from surface water and aren't supposed to end up in your groundwater, although we've had at least 1 every time we've tested. On the upside, not all coliforms make you sick, although you never know which ones you are dealing with until it is too late! We also found out that our water hardness has increased significantly since we first had it tested. After some research, Chris determined how much we should turn up our water softener to account for this. While this did improve the taste of our water, we calculated that drinking the recommended 8 glasses a day we were getting 53% of our daily recommended salt intake! As a side note about the water softener, we suspect that is where the coliforms might be hiding. With guests arriving soon, we decided to open up our big blue jugs of water from the grocery store that we have been keeping in the basement for some sort of water emergency and leave sorting out the coliforms until the New Year.</p>

<p>In exciting social news, this month we received our first social invitation since moving here. One of the families on the fire department invited us to go with them to the school Christmas dinner and concert. Now I don't know about you, but my imagination of school Christmas concerts involve never-ending off-key singing by small children while parents valiantly try to look awake and supportive as the concert moves into hour two! However, we don't get invited out a lot so there was no way we were saying no! We arrived promptly at 5pm to find out that dinner was a two hour affair, with the concert only starting at 7pm! Dinner was tasty, but it was a long wait for the entertainment to start. However, we were very pleasantly surprised by the schools interpretation of The Grinch Who Stole Christmas. They had a very engaging and charismatic Grinch, the younger kids sang carols during the interludes, and it was short and punchy. The people who invited us admitted it was one of the best they had attended!</p>

<p>While this brings us to nearly the end of the month, it was all leading up to the Christmas week and the arrival of our guests. Jess and Bailey arrived on the night of the 23rd. While they were here we enjoyed beautiful weather with very picturesque frost on the trees that glittered in the sun. We took dogs on walks, one of which was to retrieve the trail camera we had positioned by a potential bear den (no pictures of bears unfortunately). We set off some fireworks which arrived courtesy of Sandy. I am starting to realize that no gathering of Camerons is really complete without fireworks! We had a wine tasting and went out one night to the Innisfree Hotel to take in the local scene. We finally used our fire ring, and even cooked hot dogs and s'mores. We opened Christmas presents and drank eggnog. We shot various things including frozen colored ice of different sizes, tins cans, and a large log. We had a very tasty Christmas dinner featuring a turkey given to us by Marlene which I "spatchcocked". If this is not a cooking technique familiar to you (it was new to me), I highly recommend it! We even survived a few hours without power on Christmas day, though the power came back on just as it was getting dark, so the candles were more for atmosphere than lighting. After Christmas dinner with the return of the power we enjoyed a feuerzangenbowle (hot spice wine that you drip caramelize sugar into by burning a sugar cone soaked in alcohol over top of) and watched a movie on our new projector from Sandy. On Boxing Day we puppy-sat a little black lab named Diesel for the day for our friends from the fire department while they visited relatives. By the end of the day the puppy had tired everyone out, even Revi, who it turns out is a very good puppy nanny.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Wine tasting on Christmas Eve. The owner of the wine store in Vegreville picked four very different wines for us, giving us (with our unsophisticated palates!) the best chance of telling them apart. We even watched a video explaining the tasting steps and ate the suggested cheese to cleanse our palates between wines. I think Bailey is the wine expert among us, as she successfully matched each mystery bottle to its identity.</span>

<p>After all of the excitement of the month, we spent the last few days of the year just relaxing, walking the dogs, taking stock, and looking forward to 2020.</p>

<p><b><i>December’s recipe recommendations</i></b><br>
We ate a lot of food in December! In fact, after realizing how much food we have in the freezer and our pantry, we have decided that we are going to see how long we can go in January (and dare I say into February?) without buying any groceries beyond milk, coffee cream, and bananas. Stay tuned for the results! But, here are a few of the standout recipes from this month
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/214217/slow-cooker-thai-pork-with-peppers/><u>Slow cooker thai pork with peppers</u></a>. This was very tasty and easy, but only if you like peanuts!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/-simple-is-best-dressing-51124210"><u>Stuffing</u></a>. Our Christmas dinner included turkey, mashed potatoes, brussels sprouts, gravy, cranberry sauce, and this very delicious stuffing. I love stuffing, but for some reason I feel intimidated when I think about making it. This one was super easy and I made it ahead and froze it until Christmas day. So tasty that I think maybe we should eat stuffing more often, but maybe it is better reserved for just a few times a year!</li>
<li><a href="https://thesaltymarshmallow.com/old-fashioned-soft-molasses-cookies/"><u>Molasses cookies</u></a>. In my opinion, these were the best of the baking I made for the Christmas cookie bags. And I must not have been alone in this opinion as I ended up making three batches of these in December!</liL
