<p>The January post is quite late, but in my defence, I've been struck by writer's block! Actually, I think it is worse than that as I couldn't even bring myself to sit down at the keyboard until quite recently. I also have yet to get my New Years letters in the mail, so apparently it is a multi-media communication block of some sort. Here's hoping that by writing this post I have lifted the block!</p>

<p>We celebrated two anniversaries this month at the property. The first at the beginning, and the second at the end of the month. On January 4th, Revi celebrated her one year anniversary of living with us. This earned her the starring role in this month's banner photo! She has settled into our family really well and has embraced all aspects of life in the country. We have certainly enjoyed having her here, and hopefully she feels the same! To commemorate her arrival, we put together a collage capturing her adventures (and mis-adventures!) over the last year. Here's to many more years together Revi-o, Reva, Ravioli, Reverie, Revi-Rover.</p>

<p>As is usually the way, early January sparked a desire to do some things we had on the back burner for a while. In this case it was to pull out our fridge to clean behind it. We purchased some sliding feet for the purpose, and with these installed under the front feet of the fridge and Chris exerting his muscle power, it slid out quite easily. Of course we found that there was about the equivalent of a dog in fur living behind and under the fridge! With this success under our belt, we decided the space behind the washer/dryer stack should receive a similar treatment. The washer/dryer was a little harder to pull out, but all was going well until we encountered a bit of resistance, followed by a crack and the sound of high pressure gas releasing! Our response was quite efficient I think given the element of surprise. I had all the dogs outside and the doors wide open (note the outdoor temp was sub -30&#8451; at the time!) and Chris was downstairs flipping the emergency shutoff (thank goodness there was one just for the dryer!) before the thought "why didn't we shut off the gas?" even crossed our minds! Of course it did afterwards, but there was no one in a position to say "I told you so", so it didn't really matter! After a bit of ventilation with the outside arctic air, we decided we had avoided the risk of explosion and peeked behind the washer/dryer to investigate what on earth had happened. It turned out that the hose connecting the back of the dryer to the gas pipe was not sufficiently long for the washer/dryer to be pulled out, so it had pulled the pipe forward and snapped it off at the base. We can only conclude that to install our washer/dryer, someone must have climbed on top of the dryer and hung down over the back in order to connect the gas with the washer/dryer in place. Whoever installed the separate gas shutoff for the dryer deserves our gratitude. Without it we would have been making a late night emergency call to the gas company while humans and canines alike stood around freezing outside. That night we retired to bed, our "can-do" spirit slightly diminished.</p>

<p>The next day Chris called Hank, who we were told was "the guy you need" by the appliance repair guy in Vegreville. Chris said Hank laughed so long after hearing our story that it got awkward and Chris had to sort of interrupt him! In the end Hank was able to come out quite quickly, turned out to be very nice, and got everything fixed right up. So, not only is there no dog hair behind our washer/dryer and we know for sure that our dryer vent hose is in fact venting outside, we are also in a position to pull out the wash/dryer next time without ripping the gas pipe off the wall. A definite plus. And, we are unlikely to forget to turn off the gas in the future!</p>

<p>I mentioned the arctic air we let into the house during the washer/dryer debacle? After a very mild and enjoyable Christmas, mid-January brought a big temperature dip. We went on several very short (10 minute) dog walks each day, and otherwise stayed hunkered down at home. We also took advantage of the chilly temperatures to defrost the freezer. As an aside, I have been working from home quite a bit so far this year. It is very nice to trade in my commuting time for more dog-walking time, and to spend time at our property during the daylight! This was particularly nice during the cold snap. Despite it being so cold, we can report that with the assistance of a block heater and battery blanket, Rolph the Golf did start at -38C (though I don't think he was happy about it)!</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Although we stayed huddled inside, the ravens braved the cold at -44&#8451;.</span>

<p>In other car-related news, Vanny Vanerson blew her power steering hose and required a bit of extra muscle to drive until she got it fixed. Though she now responds to a gentler touch, she sounds a bit off, leading us to think this fix may be short-lived.</p>

<p>A normally routine activity we haven't been doing much of in January is grocery shopping. Readers might remember we decided after the food abundance of Christmas to see how long we could go without buying groceries aside from milk and bananas. We have been working our way through freezer and pantry, and as of the end of January are still going strong! I am starting to feel a little twitchy about the possibility of scurvy, but Chris and the internet assure me that we haven't reached that stage yet! I am finding it quite interesting to see what it is like to have a limited food store (luckily not something I have experienced in a non-experimental setting), and I am looking forward to see how it changes our approach to cooking and grocery shopping once we start buying food again.</p>

<p>At the begining of the post I mentioned two anniversaries in January. Revi's arrival was the first and the second was the one year anniversary of our blogs! It was a bit iffy at times, but we managed to achieve our goal of posting to the Property Report once a month throughout 2019. To kick off the blog in 2020, we decided to make some changes. We (Hannah) spent quite a lot of time in January moving the Property Report and Travels blog to their new home on Github. This will give us more control over the blog, and is also free! In addition, we combined the two blogs, so now you can read about what we are up all in the same spot, whether we are at home or away. We are also shaking things up and replacing the "Monthly Recipe Suggestions" with "Monthly Property Indicator(s)". Each month we will report one (or more) significant numbers about the property or activities occurring here. To ease the transition, this month is a blend of both old and new.</p>

<h5>January's property indicator(s)</h5>
<p>The first indicator is the temperature, which was cold!

<p>The second indicator relates to something hot! I got an Instant Pot for Christmas this year from Marlene, so I have been busy testing it out. I believe it has made cooking dinner much more relaxing. After a bit of chopping and possibly some browning or sauteing, I can just put all the ingredients in, close the lid, and enjoy doing something else while it cooks. No need to mind the stove! As someone who routinely boils over pots of all kinds, this is pretty amazing!

Also, you can cook meat from frozen in the Instant Pot (<a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/the-5-best-frozen-foods-to-cook-in-your-instant-pot-247269"><u>following a few tips</u></a>), which is a game changer!</li>

<li><a href="https://www.smartnutrition.ca/recipes/moroccan-beef-lentils/"><u>Moroccan beef and lentils</u></a>, I made it with deer that was gifted to us by someone from work.</li>
<li>Baked beans. I sort of followed <a href="https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/instant-pot-baked-beans/"><u>this recipe</u></a>, but as I often tell Chris, "It's experimental"! They were delish, thanks in part to the can of beer I added I suspect!</li>
<li>I've also tested out the Instant Pot for cooking steel cut oats, rice, and a variety of dried beans.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, that was January. We look forward to seeing what else 2020 has in store for us. While a lot can change in a year, a lot can stay the same as well. It all depends on perspective, which we can now get (at least in part) from our blog archives.</p>
