<p>February. The shortest of all months (even with the added bonus day included), but coming at the darkest and coldest time of the year. Due to its location in the heart of winter, February has inspired such quotes as</p><p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">"February is a suitable month for dying. Everything around is dead, the trees black and frozen so that the appearance of green shoots two months hence seems preposterous, the ground hard and cold, the snow dirty, the winter hateful, hanging on too long."<br>
-  Anna Quindlen, One True Thing</blockquote>

<p>Unlike last year when we escaped on our honeymoon to summer in New Zealand, we spent this February at the Property. We enjoyed many wonderful dog walks. I (Hannah) have been working from home most days, which gives me the opportunity to take the dogs for a second walk in the afternoon during the time I would otherwise be commuting home from the office. A good trade-off! The dogs and I enjoyed some truly breathtaking evening walks and I felt very grateful to be able to savour these extra daylight hours by snowshoe. We also enjoyed our daily morning walks. Thanks to these walks, the following quote more accurately captured Februrary for us this year.</p>
  
<blockquote class="blockquote">"Keep your faith in beautiful things;<br>
in the sun when it is hidden,<br>
in the Spring when it is gone."<br>
-  Roy R. Gibson</blockquote>

<p>To better accommodate both of us now working from home, we started out the month with a small remodel of our desk area in the living room. I loved the idea of the secretary writing desk we had, but despite our best efforts it always seemed messy. Granted the before photo is a bit unfair to the desk as it was Christmas morning, but it gives you the idea.</p>

<p>With some creative thinking, internet searching, the help of Ikea, and amateur (but increasing!) building skills, we created what I think turned out to be a modern, functional, and welcoming workspace! Chris created a "charging drawer" which makes charging our various devices easy, and he also achieved the long awaited goal of connecting our printer to the internet. No more crawling into tight spaces to connect cables like cave people, now we can now transmit data over the air! While the circular saw was out, we took the opportunity to cut an extra shelf for the skinny cupboard where we store our cookie sheets and saran wrap/tinfoi/etc. This cupboard (and my sanity) is much improved after the increased organization provided by the addition of an extra shelf. Makes one wonder why it seems to be in our nature to put off for so long these simple things, which take very little time and improve our daily lives so much.</p>

<p>There was one final building project completed in February. Always curious to learn about different dog training techniques, Hannah came across a podcast from the Canine Paradigm entitled "Mysteries of the Box" (<a href="http://www.thecanineparadigm.com/2017/12/16/episode-4-mysteries-of-the-box/">listen to it here</a>). The idea is that you can develop mental toughness in your dog, which will help them tolerate (and even lean into) things in the world they might find scary or uncomfortable (think vet visits), all by feeding them in a box! So of course we built Seuss a box and he has been searching its depths to uncover the mystery while enjoying his meals.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Seuss preparing to eat his breakfast out of the box. The idea is in fact not to stand it in, but I belive he felt that might speed up the meal delivery service.</span>

<p>As the winter progresses, our compost bin is filling with frozen food scraps from the Red Brick cafe, and on warmer afternoons it is starting to smell a little. I suppose some olfatory foreshadowing of what awaits us once spring does arrive! We decided to set up a trail camera to see if anyone was visting at night. To our surprise, the visitors were flying squirrels! And boy did they visit a lot. Nice to know someone is benefiting from our composting efforts!</p>

<p>The squirrels weren't the only animals enjoying a feast in February. We, or more accurately the dogs, were gifted some moose meat and bones from one of our friends on the fire department. Having more than we could feed the dogs, we set out a few bones around our property in the hopes of catching some foxes or coyotes on our trail cameras. It turns out that the magpies are first on scene, and they don't leave much for second comers! However, this did mean that Tammi disappeared like clockwork on every walk to go to "the meat", and we captured her making her way home on camera a few times!</p>

<p>Later in the month, likely in anticipation of spring, there was an uptick in squirrel activity. This led to a loud work environment for Chris in his cabin office as the squirrels engaged in their socializations in the nearby trees, and also to highly vigilant dogs who felt the need to keep an eye on (and inform us of!) all squirrel activities.</p>

<p>A side note related to the cabin office (this is Chris now) - we found it amusing that I had my first official "business" visitor to my office shed this month. I was helping someone from Innisfree change hosting providers for a website, and she came by to take a look at some things. I brought in an extra chair from the house, and when she showed she didn't bat an eye when I pointed towards my shed. The office worked just fine, and with room to spare.
</p>

<p>We also started buying groceries again this month, and at a higher rate than originally planned due to the arrival of COVID-19. It turns out that our timing of eating through our food stores may not have been ideal! Not wanting to be caught without some stores in the case of any social distancing that might occur in the near future, we did a bit of stocking up on beans and rice, as well as frozen fruit and vegetables. So, while the risk of COVID-19 is still on the horizon, we have solidly banished scurvy back to the 1800s!</p>

<p>At the end of the month Hannah noticed some chickadees investigating the bird boxes. In respose to demand, we went around and cleaned out the boxes from last year and added a few inches of woodchips to entice any chickadees to consider taking up residence when the time comes. Sadly we found several dead tree swallows, as we did last year. This year the mortalities were confined to two boxes of the same design. Originally designed for bluebirds (which we have not seen since our first summer here), these boxes are deeper and clearly seem to be a bad idea for tree swallows. So, we have taken them down and will make some modifications for this season. We also found that most boxes were stuffed full of sticks, a sure sign of house wren activity. Hopefully a bit of research will reveal what can be done to encourage some tennants other than wrens.</p>

<h5>February's property indicator(s)</h5>

<p>The indicator for February is:</p>
  
<indicator>721.1 kWh</indicator>

<p>We (Chris) have recently been paying close attention to our electricity usage after Chris got an Efergy home energy monitor for Christmas. Increased monitoring is in anticipation of plans under development to make our house greener soon! For now, we will say only that we are looking forward with great expectation to enjoying the increasing power of the solar rays hitting our roof as the sun traverses higher in the sky!</p>
