<p>I am sitting down to write this blog post long after March has come and gone.</p>

<p>In February we were still ignorant to the magnitude of the shift that was about to occur due to the emergence of COVID-19. On March 11th the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic, although with cases spread across the world and increasing rapidly, by that point it was mostly a formality. Any remaining naivety we may have had about what was to follow was abruptly shattered over the next weeks. A new normal started to take shape. Life now included 14-day self-isolation for returning travelers, restrictions on gatherings, staying home and keeping 6 feet apart. It did not include schools or daycares, or access to city and provincially run facilities such as recreation centers and parks. Most businesses were closed and all food was take-out. Those who could worked from home, but many people suddenly had no work. Governments started stepping in with programs and legislation changes in an effort to soften the blow. Watching the news and reading people's personal accounts on Facebook revealed a world in upheaval, at a standstill, apart. A bit disconcertingly, life remained relatively normal for us here at the property. I was already working from home, luckily with a secure job. Chris continued his courses, which have always been online. We have no kids to find themselves suddenly out of school. After a few sleepless nights, I disconnected from the news, took a deep breath, and found that my new normal wasn't too far away from my old normal.</p>

<p>I did start one new habit to cope with the pandemic, which is to sit down each night and write a daily email to the people I love. This strange time of isolation was a catalyst for beginning something I found that I have wanted for a while. To be more connected and to know more about what is going on in the lives of my friends and family. Everyone is always present in my thoughts, but I wanted to make that connection more intentional. So, on March 21st I began bombarding these unsuspecting people with the details of my days, and in return was rewarded with some details about theirs. Originally I intended this to be something that lasted until things returned to normal, and I'll admit that some nights it is a challenge to write the email. But, the longer I continue this daily ritual, I begin to wonder if it perhaps it will also become part of my new normal.</p>

<p>In March I signed up for a few online conditioning courses to learn the fitness foundations to help keep all our dogs healthy in their various activities and stages of life. This led to a shortage of indoor training space and some serious spring fever associated with my desire to be able to do these exercises outside. Unfortunately I was confronted at the door with snow drifts and windchill! Luckily, due to our open concept design I was able to transform our kitchen into a temporary doggie gym. This worked quite well, but required frequent set-ups and tear-downs so we could use our kitchen for other things, like meals. Doggie workouts are also quite rambunctious affairs and involve a lot of flying kibble. This, combined with the fact that the doggie gym (kitchen) represents approximately half the footprint of our house, means that its operation impacts the rest of the household. I'm not sure Chris minds too much as he has his office shed to retreat to, but since the gym only accommodates one patron at a time, the other dogs get a bit excited about it. I continue to look forward to our future garage construction, whenever it happens.</p>

<p>With the gym up and running, I finally ordered a new remote for my Treat'n Train. This is a automated food delivery device you can use to give treats to the dog away from you, instead of having the dog always getting treats from you. You can see it on the carpet by the door in the photo above. It is helpful in different applications and for some types of exercises. It is also like a slot machine for dogs. When I push the button on the remote, it beeps, then gears turn, and finally a kibble or two drop out. The dogs catch on to this little routine quite quickly, and if left to their own devices would camp out in front of the Treat'n Train all day. So, there was much excitement all around when the remote arrived, but unfortunately despite lots of beeping and whirring, no kibble was coming out. Chris and I took it apart and discovered the problem to be years of built-up kibble dust causing things to stick. Yuck! We cleaned it, and after waiting for it to dry following Hannah injudiciously dowsing it in water, several re-assemblies and dis-assemblies to get all the gears aligned properly, I had a fully functional Treat'n Train... and one extra screw.</p>

<p>I don't think I've written about it before, but in December we finally decided to get a TV. While I was an unwilling convert at first, and still watch Heartland on my laptop, I do enjoy watching movies on a larger screen. Of course, for the authentic movie night experience we go to the office and set up the projector we got from Sandy for Christmas. And I am looking forward to our first drive-in outdoor movie this summer. But, on a normal night we can now use the TV. It turns out that we are not the only ones who appreciate the big screen. Seuss, Sadie, and Tammi don't take much note of it, but Revi often gets caught up in the programming, even when it is not squirrel related.</p>

<p>Near the end of the month we experienced a warm day and Chris noticed some drips coming from the top of one of our bathroom windows. The last time we had dripping like this, granted it was quite a bit more extensive, we ended up having the traditional batting insulation in our roof replaced with spray foam insulation. A big expense of both money, energy, and sanity. So this time we wiped up the drips, they never came back, and we don't speak about them.</p>

<p>At the end of the month we started some seeds, which means we are committed to constructing a vegetable garden this summer so we have somewhere to transplant the little seedlings, if any sprout! This activity was set into motion when we were gifted the seed starter peat pucks by one of our friends in town. She was telling us how her daughter had started all their seeds already, so I think we may be a bit behind schedule. Our seeds are a miscellaneous assortment of packages collected over the years. So far there are no signs of life, though I would not encourage the seeds to rush in their germination as it will be some time still before conditions outdoors are favorable to growth. Not much changed weather-wise this month from start to finish.</p>

<h5>March property indicator(s)</h5>

<p>The indicator this month is all about household waste. To collect this data we weighed the garbage and recycling at the start and end of the month. We didn't capture everything as we did not weigh the compost or the recyclables we return for a deposit. Since this is the first time we have measured this, we have no idea if this month was average or not, or how it compares to other Canadians. I did find a <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canadians-produce-more-garbage-than-anyone-else-1.1394020">CBC article</a> about this topic. According to the Conference Board of Canada, Canadians produce more garbage per capita than any other country on earth. Yikes! We're also interested to know what makes up our garbage as this will give us clues about how to reduce it. I suspect it is mainly pliable plastics. We eat a lot of frozen vegetables and fruit, which all come in non-recyclable plastic bags. In any case, we have watched many documentaries lately about recycling which suggest that it is not as sustainable a practice as people once thought. Better just to try to avoid packaging entirely, which umfortunately is not easily done.</p>
