In preparing to write this month's Property Report post, I re-read the post from last January. It seemed like just yesterday, but also like many years ago. The world in 2020 was just bananas! I expect 2021 will have many similarities and be equally trying, but at least it won't come as such a shock.

In March I started writing a daily email to family and friends, to help everyone stay connected in a strange time. As a result, the Property Report went silent. I was initially planning to complete the monthly Property Report posts for 2020 by looking back through the dailies, but I have decided no to. For one thing, I am slowly putting all the dailies on the companion blog, [The Daily](https://propertyreport.upnix.com/thedaily/), and these daily observations capture most things worth reporting on already. For another, I have something new I want to write about here.

Last spring Chris and I signed up for an online permaculture design course. Permaculture, at its most basic, is an approach to land management based on mimicking nature. But it is much more than that. Certainly more than we could grasp before the snow melted and we suddenly had less time to spend indoors. Although we abandoned the course, it has remained in the back of my mind. I wanted to return to the course, to explore permaculture further, and to apply its ideas on our property. As a way to do this I have decided to write about it here on the blog. This will be a shift from my previous writing, and a new style for me. You can expect some philosophizing. There will be discussions of the climate, water flow, soils, and trees of our property. I will share rough design ideas which will be sketched out, revised, and rejected... only to be revisited again. Hopefully an overall design will emerge, and I can share stories of our successes and failures in bringing that design to life. One thing I have learned is that permaculture is as much about people and community as it is about land management. I hope that by sharing my adventure here I can tap in to my community, which will certainly help me succeed, or at least will keep me company while I try!
