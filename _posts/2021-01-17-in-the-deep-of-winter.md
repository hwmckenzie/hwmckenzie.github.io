The best time for planning is before the action. Once the action starts, you  become fully immersed in it and lose all interest in *planning*. All of your energy is directed towards *doing*. Or at least that has been my experience. 

Canadian winter, with its short days and long nights, humbly offers itself as a natural pause. It is a time for dreaming and brainstorming. For asking questions and doing research to find answers. With much of the natural world at rest, doing can be set aside and planning takes the stage. Although it has been a mild winter so far, this feeling of breathing space remains. As I write this, I am sitting in the sunny reading corner of our house with a coffee, gazing out the window at the winter sunshine illuminating our snowy yard and the leafless branches of trees in the distance. I sit at the beginning of what I hope will be a journey during which Chris and I will deepen our connection with the land through permaculture. 

It is perhaps not quite true to consider this the beginning. Certainly we have been making changes to our property since the day we arrived. We built a house, planted trees, dug a perennial garden, put up bird feeders, and acquired animals. We are also not entirely new to the idea of permaculture. Last spring we took an online permaculture design course. The course itself was rich in information and ideas. Absorbing all of the material was exhausting and overwhelming. We have yet to watch all of the lectures and read through all of the content. But the most challenging aspect was the timing. It butted right up against spring, which is not a natural time for planning, but for action! So all last spring, summer and fall, at the mercy of nature's cycle, with only a beginner's knowledge and no overall design, we *did*. And as the last chorus of fall gave way to the first notes of winter, we declared that next year would be different. This year we had toiled on our land. Next year we would take time to relax and connect with the nature and land that surrounds us. We would find joy in our property.

This brings me to a sticky point. Will it be possible to find joy and relaxation in the process of designing our permaculture property and then implementing that design? Or will it just be toiling under a new guise? From what I have learned so far, everything suggests that permaculture often requires a large initial input of energy. Many properties need to undergo an abrupt and substantive shift. This shift requires human energy, but may also include major earthworks, construction, and plantings. All of which require an investment of financial resources. But once that shift has occurred, the magic happens! If it has been designed well, nature takes over and cares for the land. But until then? 

Luckily it costs nothing, and is very low risk, to sit in a reading nook in January imagining what a thriving permaculture property looks like! I hope that through sharing this journey here over the course of the next few months I am able to create a permaculture design for our property that we can begin to bring to life this summer. A plan that has room for plenty of enjoyment and relaxation, hand in hand with the doing.
