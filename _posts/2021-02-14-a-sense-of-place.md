Many treatments of permaculture begin with a discussion of values and ethics, principles and directives, and the theoretical underpinnings and framework. While valuable, it is an uphill climb and a challenging way to begin. Instead I decided to start by telling you about our land. The land is what brought me to permaculture in the first place, so it really is the best place to begin.

In crude terms, our land is a 36 acre parcel just north-east of Innisfree. But of course it is so much more. Often described by visitors as "a little piece of paradise" or a "magical spot", it is home to plants, animals, and insects. And of course us! Hearing these comments from visitors is always a good reminder to me not to take our land for granted or overlook how special this place is. When we purchased it, we became its stewards. While I often feel I am at the mercy of our land, in truth it is at our mercy. If we wanted, and had vast amounts of money to burn, we could clear it and turn it into a crop field. A sobering thought. This means it is not only what we do that is important, but also what we don't do. For a doer such as myself, that is the kind of realization that takes a day or so to digest!

With the assistance of Chris and his drone, I created a narrated tour of our property which you can watch [here](https://youtu.be/y5MIh_gc2ZQ). Hopefully this gives a good overview of the land we are working with and hoping to nurture, so that it might in turn nurture us. 

In the next post I am planning to continue talking about our property. I will look at local site characteristics including topography, drainage, and geology, as well as the regional climactic patterns such as temperature, rainfall, and wind. It is the intersection of these which will provide guidance about what plants, animals, and strategies will do well here.
