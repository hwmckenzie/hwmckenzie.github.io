After taking a tour of our property in the last post, now I am searching for a deeper understanding of the land. To practice permaculture is to work with and learn from nature, not to try to turn it into something it is not. So, I ask myself, what does our land want to be?

To find out, I looked up how our land is classified according to the natural subregions of Alberta. This classification is based on biogeographic features including geology, landform, soils and hydrology, as well as the climate, vegetation and wildlife. Much of the information in this post came from the *Natural Regions and Subregions of Alberta*<sup>1</sup>.

Our property is located at the north end of the Central Parkland subregion.

<img class="img-fluid" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/2021-02/central-parkland-map.jpg" alt="[Image: Central Parkland Map]"><span class="caption text-muted">The central parkland subregion is shown in brown. We live at the star, approximately! (map: Alberta Environment and Parks).</span>

The central parkland subregion covers 8% of Alberta, lying between the cold, snowy northern forests and the warm, dry southern grasslands. It is the fertile crescent of Alberta, and because of this it is both densely populated and a highly productive agricultural region. In fact, only 5% remains in native vegetation. After learning that most of this region is either developed, under cultivation, or used for grazing, I appreciate our property even more and recognize how unique it is. While I am not sure if our property is truly native central parkland, it is certainly less disturbed than most of the surrounding area. We are also very lucky to have a large conservation area next to us, which connects our small property to a much larger natural area that provides habitat for many plants and wildlife.

#### Climate
We are located in the grasslands ecoclimatic region. It is characterized by cold winters (true!) and short hot summers, with July being the warmest month. Precipitation peaks in July, with significant rainfall in June and August as well, however overall there is low annual precipitation. The region has relatively high insolation (solar radiation), which is good news for our solar panels! Our growing season is May to September, although most growth happens after June due to moisture availability, high evaporation, and drying westerly winds.

#### Vegetation

The topography is flat to gently undulating, creating a mosaic arrangement of tree groves with pockets of open grasslands. There are two major forest types. Balsam poplar (*Populus balsamifera*) occupy the lower wet areas and trembling aspen (*Populus tremuloides*) occur on the dry sites. Imagine my surprise to discovery that aspen are actually in the poplar family! The only coniferous tree native to our region is the white spruce, which can occur on moist protected sites. While we have aspen and poplar on our property, as well as three birch trees (we counted!), the only spruce trees we have are near the house and were likely planted by earlier owners. I will try to look at them more closely to see if I can tell what kind of spruce they are.

The understory is very dense with many fruiting shrubs including snowberry, saskatoons, beaked hazelnut, chokecherry, pin cherry and bunchberry. In the moist areas there are red dogwood, pussy willows, gooseberry, green alder, honeysuckle, and baneberry (not to be confused with wild cranberry, this one is poisonous!).

We also have Alberta wild roses, as well as many other flowers including prairie crocus, prairie sagewort, wild blue flax, northern bedstraw, and three-flowered avens to name just a few.

While I recognize many of the trees, shrubs and flowers, I am much less familiar with the grasses. From my reading, where soils are moist the natural grasslands are made up of plains rough fescue, slender wheat grass and forbs (aka wildflowers!). The dry rapidly drained soils are home to western porcupine grass, June grass, needle-and-thread, blue grama, dryland sedges and pasture sagewort. Hopefully this summer I can get to know the differences between all of these! Unfortunately these natural grassland communities are very rare, as many have been taken over by smooth brome or Kentucky bluegrass. Our hill, as well as several slopes in the conservation area, are grassland communities. I will have to check this summer to see if I can identify either the native grasses or the invading brome and Kentucky bluegrass. I'm sure whatever is growing in our yard is not native! Maybe the sheep can put a dent it in this summer.

#### Soils

Where I am shaky on grasses, I am completely ignorant about soils. The *Alberta Soil Viewer*<sup>3</sup> tells me that our property is sitting on top of "Orthic Black Chernozem on medium textured till." Hmmmm... Upon further reading<sup>4</sup>, this makes a lot of sense as I learned that Black Chernozems usually occur in association with a native vegetation of mixed grass, forb, and tree cover, just like what is found in the central parkland. It is also a very good thing for us because these soils are very productive. There are also Dark Gray Chernozems and Luvisols occurring under the forests in the central parkland, as well as significant occurrences of Solonetzic soils. I was particularly interested to read about solonetzic soils. These soils occur on parent materials containing sodium salts or in lowland areas influenced by ground water discharge. They are often referred to as clay-pan soils, as they develop a hard layer which is difficult for roots to grow through. While it looks like we are not in the solonetzic soil belt, we are close, and I've seen salt in fields along the highway. After only some brief research this afternoon, I can say there is a lot to learn about soils! I am looking forward to digging some holes this summer to see what is happening underground. I expect I will write a whole post at some point just about soils. They will be much easier to investigate once the snow melts and the ground thaws!

There are lots of small waterbodies and wetlands in our region, many being marshes and seasonal ponds. In fact, this region has been nicknamed the "duck factory" of North America! We have a dugout on our property which collects significant spring runoff and overflows eventually into the marsh in the conservation area. The conservation area itself is situated in a natural wetland, which has been dammed in several spots to create a series of ponds.

#### Animals

Only one vertebrate, the prairie vole, appears to be found solely in the central prairie region. I have not seen any, but I can confirm their presence on our property based on the mounds they make! While there is not much wildlife unique to our region, we are lucky to have a great diversity of wildlife as we are at the interface of both the boreal forest to the north and the grasslands to the south. We have been lucky to see many birds and animals while living here, including deer, moose, beavers, porcupines, raccoons, flying squirrels, fisher, coyotes, and foxes, as well as a variety of birds including chickadees, nuthatches, hawks, owls, blue jays, waxwings, grossbeaks, goldfinches, house wrens, grouse, and woodpeckers. We've even seen two of Alberta's reptiles, the plains garter snake and the tiger salamander. As I write this, I realize how much the presence of these creatures adds to our daily enjoyment. Anything we do on our property certainly has to preserve or improve the habitat for them.

I hope this post has given you a deeper feel for our property. I learned a lot writing it and definitely recognize our property in the descriptions of the central parkland. I was also amazed by how many free resources are available online for learning about where we live. I was quite heartened when I came across this quote in particular:

<blockquote class="blockquote">"The Central Parkland Natural Subregion is highly productive for annual crops because summer precipitation is adequate, the growing season is sufficiently warm and long, and soils are suitable.</blockquote>

How exciting!!! In addition to being home to a diverse group of plants and animals, it sounds like our property is in a location favourable to growing food! 

After all my reading, I find myself looking with fresh eyes as I walk around our property and the conservation area with the dogs. I am excited to explore many of the topics I learned about further in future posts. Perhaps with some hands on aspects! However, spring is on its way and so I must continue on to the property design.
