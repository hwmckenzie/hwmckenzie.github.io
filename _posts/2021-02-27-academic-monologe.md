Now that I have an understanding that our property wants to be central parkland, and what that means, it is time to start thinking about how we can design a place for ourselves here. After all, permaculture is not about regenerating the land to its native state, separate from humans. I think this is a good time to take a look at what following a permaculture approach really means, at least as far as I understand it!

Permaculture was originally developed by Bill Mollison and David Holmgren in Australia in the 1970s. Bill Mollison described permaculture as

<blockquote class="blockquote">“The conscious design and maintenance of agriculturally productive systems which have the diversity, stability, and resilience of natural ecosystems. It is the harmonious integration of the landscape with people providing their food, energy, shelter and other material and non-material needs in a sustainable way.” </blockquote>

The motivation for taking up the permaculture approach is communicated by the prime directive.

>The only ethical decision is to take responsibility for our own existence and that of our children. 

While personal responsibility is a value most parents try to instill in their children, it is certainly not universal, and maybe not encouraged or required in our society as much as it used to be. Permaculture is very much about taking responsibility. This prime directive is followed by a three part statement of ethics which provides guidance on how to proceed.

>Earth care, People care, and Fair share

The need to care for the earth (soil, water, air, and living things) comes from an understanding and acceptance that we are interconnected with nature, and we rely on it for our survival. There is (so far) only one earth after all! The requirement to care for people (self, family, and community) comes from the observation that cooperative species and associations of self-supporting species form healthy communities. Finally, the idea of fair share (setting limits to population and consumption, and redistributing surplus) acknowledges that continuous growth is unsustainable and we need to know what is "enough" for ourselves and act accordingly.

These ethics guide the use of twelve design principles.

>* Observe and interact
>* Catch and store energy
>* Obtain a yield
>* Apply self-regulation and feedback
>* Use and value renewables
>* Produce no waste
>* Design from patterns to details
>* Integrate rather than segregate
>* Use small and slow solutions
>* Use and value diversity
>* Use edges and value the marginal
>* Creatively use and respond to change

The interesting thing here is that while the particular techniques used may vary depending on the location of the property, the design principles are strategic and universally applicable whether you are living in the tropics, the desert... or the central parkland!

I think I will not go further into these principles now, but I will talk about them more as I encounter them throughout the design process. As I go forward with my design I will have to keep these principles at the top of mind, and ask myself if I am applying them in a way that is in line with the ethics and prime directive of permaculture. 

In his book *Permaculture: a designers' manual*, Bill Mollison also adds five more of what he calls "Mollisonian Permaculture Principles", though they seem more like adages to me. If permaculture had catch-phrases, these would be them!

>* Work with nature rather than against it
>* The problem is the solution
>* Make the least change for the greatest possible effect
>* The yield of a system is theoretically unlimited, and is only limited by the imagination of the designer
>* Everything gardens, or has an effect on its environment

One thing that struck me is that while permaculture is often though of in the context of farming, it is also very much a cultural movement, where the focus is on effecting global change through personal actions. The message being that you must start by setting your own house in order, and from that other things will follow. This is in contrast with trying to change others, a commonly observed human endeavor!

So there you have it, a crash course in permaculture. I am beginning to believe that permaculture is more of an on-going process of trying, observing, learning, and adapting, rather than an arrival at a particular end destination. I take that as a licence to dip my feet in and get started, even though I still have a lot to learn.
