It is beautiful out today, and a hard thing to be sitting inside. At least the dogs are enjoying the sunshine on the deck. I can see them all from where I sit as I write in our reading nook, so I know they are not getting into any mischief, at least at the moment! Spring has sprung and nature is already starting to implement her design for our property. If I have any hope of influencing her direction, I must submit my ideas for consideration very soon! 

From my reading, it seems the success of a permaculture design lies not so much in having the right components, but in how the components you have are arranged and the relationships between them. Mollison writes,

> As in the body, the parts function *in relation to one another*.

So, the design speaks to the arrangement of the parts. To bring the design to life requires techniques (e.g. composting), strategies (e.g. crop rotations), and materials, but the design itself guides how and where these things are applied. The same parts can lead to a property which needs constant energy to support, or a harmonious system that nourishes life. Having experienced the former, we're aiming for a design which achieves the latter! 

Mollison proposes several methods for developing a design, including: 
* *Analysis*, design based on the "needs and yields" of the components
* *Observation*, design from direct observations of the site
* *Deduction from nature*, design by adopting lessons learned from nature
* *Data overlay*, design by overlaying maps
* *Random assembly*, design by assessing the results of randomly connecting components
* *Flow diagrams*, design by considering work flows
* *Zones & sectors*, design based on energy flows
 
The idea is to use some or all of these methods to come up with an initial design, implement it in small steps, and then observe and revise it in a continuous process.

Some of these approaches speak to me more than others. Initially I was very taken with the idea of data overlays. In this method, one assembles as many informational map layers about the property as possible, overlays them, and a design emerges (apparently!). I am now quite familiar with this process as I have been stuck here for many months! There are always more map layers to consider (terrain, aspect, slope, vegetation, water flow, etc...) and different ways to display them. And while there is a lot of spatial information available, it is not always at the right scale. Mollison also warns that some things cannot be captured in layers, such as ethical, financial, and cultural constraints. Over time I have come to think of this approach as an onion. You can peel away more and more layers and it makes you cry! 

With that image in mind, I will share what I have learned from the data overlay method with a series of maps. Hopefully this will allow me to bring my investigations with data overlays to a close!

The first map shows how our property is influenced by the regional topography. The surrounding area is relatively hilly. Our property is bisected by an intermittent stream that runs from the east, through our dugout, and overflows into a ravine that eventually empties into the marsh in the conservation area. This stream is fed by snow melt in the spring, running only from about the end of March to mid to late April. The dugout also receives spring snow melt for about a week from the valley you cross on the way to the hill. The water level in the dugout is highest just after the spring melt, and drops quite a bit by the end of the summer. This is the only surface water on our property.

The arrows indicate how the water from the spring melt flows through our property. Our house is located at the star.</span>

From the elevation map we can create maps of slope (the steepness of the terrain) and aspect (the direction the slope faces). Both slope and aspect are important considerations for growing. For these maps I have zoomed in to focus on what I call the "main yard". This is where our design will focus. I call the area south of the dugout the "wildlands", and although we walk through it everyday with the dogs, I can't imagine ever developing it in any way beyond some minor walking trail maintenance.

<img class="img-fluid" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/2021-03/maps-main-yard-base.JPG" alt="[Image: Main yard slope and aspect maps]"><span class="caption text-muted">Slope and aspect maps of the main yard, showing the existing structures and fences.</span>

From these maps you can see that the main yard is south-facing with the area near the house being flat and the rest of the main yard having a gentle slope. At least at the resolution of the elevation map. The good news is that overall our main yard is quite favourable for growing in terms of slope and aspect!

What is not apparent from these maps are the elevation changes too small to be captured by the elevation map whose resolution is 30m x 30m. For example, while our main yard looks to be uniformly south-facing in aspect at the scale of the elevation map, there are some spots which have a north-facing microclimate. And while from the map the main yard appears to be uniform in slope, it is actually quite undulating. Still, not bad considering these inferences about the topography come from a satellite many thousands of miles away! 

To get a sense of what is happening at the smaller scale we must rely on direct observation. In the description below I go a bit beyond the terrain and also talk about the existing vegetation, another feature that is hard to capture with a data layer at a meaningful scale.  

I have included an image of the main yard taken by Chris's drone to help you visualize the area as you read through my observations.

Our property, like the surrounding area, is relatively hilly. Coming up the driveway is like riding a very mild roller coaster, though there is the potential for a jump at the end, depending on your speed! A caragana hedge lines the west side of the driveway as you approach the house, and there is also a row and a stand of spruce, all planted by earlier inhabitants. Unfortunately the caragana has escaped into the surrounding forest and forms dense stands which out-compete other species. While we have made peace with the hedge, we have started work to remove the caragana where it has established elsewhere on the property. No small task! The driveway loops around at the end, depositing you at the north end of the main yard.

The main yard is in the shape of a bowl, with our dog fence running around the high sides, and the barn and sheds at the bottom. The house sits at the top of a rise at the northeast end of the bowl on a bit of a flat area. 

Although there was no house on the property when we bought it, our cabin is not the first house to sit in its location. In addition to finding bits of the concrete foundation during the excavation of our basement, the old house site is clearly defined by a row of Manitoba maples, an elm tree by the front door, and lilacs. 

Most of the yard site is open and grassy, though several stands of native bush remain including choke cherry, pin cherry, saskatoons, and wild roses. The grass in the main yard is not native prairie grasslands, but more likely (TBD this summer!) the invasive smooth brome. It gets quite overwhelming in the summer, quickly growing to waist height, and was one of the motivating factors behind the acquisition of the sheep! 

In addition to the house, the yard has five buildings. Two of the sheds (the bat shed and the pigeon shed) are in relatively good repair, while the third (unnamed shed) is open to the elements. The barn is not structurally sound, but looks nice. Perhaps we will find a use for it yet! The winter chicken coop and the office are the newest and most used buildings. There are also three sets of pens in the yard, which I'm sure we can make use of, I'm just not sure how yet.

So, there you have it, a summary of my findings from the data overlay method of design. I think a close look at the topography from a map perspective has laid a good base from which to go forward. In the next post I will explore the zones and sectors analysis method. This builds on the data overlay approach by adding representations of the internal and external energies moving throughout the property to the map. It brings the humans into the picture and really starts to help inform placement of the different components.
