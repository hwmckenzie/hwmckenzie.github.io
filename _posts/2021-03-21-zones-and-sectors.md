Freed from the data layers, I'm starting to feel some momentum building! The next design method I am going to apply is Zone and Sector analysis. As I hinted at the end of the last post, this approach considers energy flow through the property. Mollison differentiates between two kinds of energies.

The first is the energy on the property. This includes the energy of any machines, fuel, humans, and wastes of the family living there. This energy is represented by *zones*. Zones guide the placement of components so as to conserve energy and time, based on the use of different areas of the property. For example, if you visit the chicken coop several times a day, it is best located near the house. 

The second is the energy flowing through the property. This includes energies such as wind, sun, precipitation, and fire. *Sectors* show where these energies enter the site. Sectors suggest the placement of components to best manage or capture the energy entering the property. For example, a wind break could be planted in the wind sector, or conversely, a windmill placed there, depending on if you wanted to protect the property from the wind or capture its energy for use. 

Let's take a closer look at zones and sectors, and I'll share my ideas of what they look like on our property.

#### Zones
Time and resources are not unlimited. I have tried to ignore this simple truth in the past, but now I am trying to embrace it! The idea of looking at the property through the zone-lens is to place things we do or need frequently, or that require a lot of our attention, close to us, thus saving time and energy. In their purest form, zones are a series of concentric circles centered on the home. Here are some characteristics of each zone as described by Mollison, and given names by me:

* *The Home* (Zone 0). This includes the house and any attached structures such as a deck or greenhouse, and living components including potted plants, trellises, and companion animals. The dogs approve of their inclusion in this zone!

* *The Dooryard* (Zone 1). Right outside the door, this zone includes components that are visited frequently or need continual observation, work input, or complex techniques. For example, laying hens, the kitchen garden, rainwater collection, collection and recycling of household wastes (e.g. composting). Mollison also suggests that this zone is suitable for "small and quiet domestic animals such as fish, rabbits, pigeons and guinea pigs." Perhaps something for the future? Keeping in mind I think he considers these to be food sources!

* *The Field and Orchard* (Zone 2). A bit further from the home, this zone requires less management and includes orchards, main-crop garden beds, small livestock and small ponds.

* *The Farm* (Zone 3). Even further a field, this zone contains commercial crops and large livestock, natural and little-pruned trees, and large water storage such as dugouts.

* *The Verge* (Zone 4). This is the border with the wilderness, but is still somewhat managed for gathering wild foods, pasture, or firewood. Water may be stored here and piped to other zones for use.

* *The Wildlands* (Zone 5). Here we find the natural, unmanaged environment. This area may be used for recreating and is also a place where we can observe nature to learn rules and get ideas which can be applied elsewhere.

Properties may not have every zone, and the shape of the zones may be adjusted to fit the terrain and accommodate the unique features of the property and its residents. In the maps below I have sketched out where I think the zones on our property are.

Our Dooryard zone consists of the flat area right around our house, up to where it starts to drop away. I also included a strip along the path to the office in this zone as Chris goes there daily. I felt that the remainder of our fenced yard fell into the Field & Orchard zone. As it is now, we don't have any Farm zone as our yard transitions quickly to a natural environment outside the fence. I included a Verge zone which encompasses the dugout and the area that feeds the dugout in the spring, as well as the driveway. Both of these are areas of water management on our property.

#### Sectors
Where zones focus on the energy internal to the property, sectors consider the energy coming onto the property from the outside. Some of these things we might want to invite onto our property, such as wildlife, while others we may wish to exclude, such as the view of the nearby junk pile. The sectors are centered on the home and represented by arcs indicating the direction from which we are expecting the energy to come. Viewing the property through the sector-lens informs the placement of components which can act as shields, deflectors, or collectors of these energies. The map below shows the different sectors I see on our property.

Sunlight is an important energy entering the property. You can see from the summer and winter sun sectors how much sunlight varies over the year. Our house and dooryard are well-situated to enjoy morning and afternoon sun year round, and for the most part this is an energy we wish to welcome and capture through our solar panels and for growing. However, our deck does experience intense sunlight in the mornings, making it quite uninhabitable.

We are also lucky to enjoy beautiful views from almost all directions. We want to enhance these views with the exception of the view to the northeast of our neighbour's junk pile and the road beyond. This is also the direction from which noise from the road enters our property, something else we would like to minimize. In addition to undesirable sights and sounds, we also have undesirable odours! These waft through the air when our septic tank pumps out. Even though only grey water ends up in our septic tank thanks to our composting toilet, it still smells quite ripe! The other negative aspect to the septic sector is salt pollution. Our water is quite hard and so we have to use water softening salts to protect our appliances. All the salt we add to our water softener gets pumped out onto our property, which is not good for the soil.

Wind energy enters the property from the west for most of the year. Cold winter winds generally come from the south and southwest, while warm summer winds (usually associated with storms) come from the northwest. Fire is also most likely to enter our property from the west. In contrast to the surrounding fields, the conservation area is full of wildfire fuel in the form of grasses, bushes, and trees. This is definitely an energy we want to protect our property from!

So what does this zone and sector analysis add to our design? Mollison provides the following counsel:

> The golden rule is to develop the nearest area first, get it under control and then expand the perimeter. A single perimeter will then enclose all your needs.

Wise words! For us this would mean focusing on the Dooryard, although we'll also have to consider the Field & Orchard since we already have some residents in that zone! In addition, it is valuable to look at the zones and sectors together. A component will fit within a particular zone, and then within that zone should be placed after considering the sectors. For example, a greenhouse would be placed in the Dooryard zone and the sun sector. Overall, the zones and sectors help define the broad patterns. If this is done well, Mollison claims that other good things will follow naturally. I am counting on it!

There is a connection back to the data overlay design method as well. Zones and sectors exist on top of slope, aspect, and elevation, all of which present opportunities and challenges to be considered as part of the design. In addition to these spatial patterns, there are also temporal weather patterns to keep in mind. Below I included the temperature, precipitation, and wind patterns throughout the year in our area.

After examining two design methods so far, I am beginning to understand that the design is a journey, not a destination. What gives the journey a direction is the purpose. In short, what do you want your property to be? After learning about the prairie parkland, I have a good idea of what Nature wants our property to be, but humans are a central component of permaculture. So we will take a small detour and in the next post I will explore what Chris and I want our property to be.
