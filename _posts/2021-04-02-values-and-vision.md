[*Authors note: This post sat for a long time in the draft stage. Between when I originally wrote it and today, I've had a bit of a shift in how I view our property (more about that soon!), although re-reading this post now, I realize many of my "new" ideas were already sitting in my subconscious just waiting to be discovered.*]

We have made a good start toward a design with the data overlays, as well as the zone and sector analysis. The options for our property design at this point are infinite. As Mollison says,

>“It is the adoption of a purpose which decides the direction of the design.”

To help narrow our focus, it is important to ask what is guiding us? What is our vision for our property and how we want to live here? What do we want our property to look and feel like? What kinds of things will happen on our property? What do we want or need our property to provide for us? 

 Clarifying our vision will help us make decisions down the road and ensure that the direction we take gets us to where we want to be. Without a clear direction, everything will be more challenging and fraught with doubt.

> “If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favourable.” — Lucius Annaeus Seneca.

This quote resonates strongly with me. There are many different winds in life, but all of them, whether strong gales or gentle breezes, will feel like headwinds unless you recognize that ones that are pushing you onwards towards your goals.

Whatever goals we have for our lives and our property are a product of our values. So the next question becomes: what are our shared values?

#### Values

>“Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.” — Aristotle 

Reflecting on our values is something that Chris and I did a while ago when we were in the process of combining our finances. At the time, we each identified five values which were of greatest importance to us. I dug out our answers and upon reconsideration, they still fit. 

Chris and I share the three values of **relationships** (friends and family), **our marriage**, and **growth** (personal, career, new experiences). Chris's other two values are **contentedness** and **places of stability**, while mine are **health** and **freedom** (having the autonomy, money, time and space to do what I want). These seven values will need to be respected with our property design or we will experience dissonance and difficulty moving forward.

This brings to mind the old adage that the ends do not justify the means. In this case, I think it serves as a warning against sacrificing our values in order to create our "ideal" property. For example, spending lots of money, blood, sweat, and tears in pursuit of developing our property, when we could have used our resources for engaging in activities that strengthen relationships, enjoying what we have, or for seeing the world beyond our property would not be the right decision. That is not to say we should abandon our property design and development, only that since the journey is an important part of the destination, how we get there must also respect our values.

#### Vision

To help us know what we are aiming for, we envisioned how our property would make us feel, what it would provide, and how we would live on it.

For me, I imagine that our will be property continuous with the natural area beside us. Our home looks like it belongs in nature and has a small footprint. I have time to relax and enjoy our property in all seasons. I do not feel overwhelmed by it. I know that our home and yard are taken care of and well maintained. I walk with our dogs through our property and the conservation area next door every day. I spend time sitting outside with my morning coffee, eating meals on the deck, laying in the hammock, and enjoying campfires. I sit and listen to the birds, walk through our garden picking food to eat, and look at the stars. Sometimes I do these things with Chris or friends and family, and sometimes by myself. Our home is a source of calm, strength, and passion, not of stress or drudgery.

I have tried to capture our shared vision for our property in the six goals below. Our property...

* Encourages us to find balance between chores and fun, with a strong leaning towards fun
* Invites us to spend more time outside, and provides opportunities for recreation and nature appreciation
* Integrates the dogs into our lives, without letting the property go to the dogs!
* Enables us to grow and raise a portion of our own food, with the potential to expand production if needed
* Is a natural continuation of the conservation area, but is clearly inhabited and cared for
* Supports and encourages a diversity of wildlife and wild plants

With this new clarity around what we hope our property will be for us, we can continue on with the design, returning to these goals whenever we encounter decisions or uncertainty. 

In the next post I will consider a Needs and Yields analysis of the components of our design. I'll look at things we already have (e.g. chickens), as well as things we might like to have (e.g. food forest). If you have been wondering when we are going to get an actual design, we are almost there!
