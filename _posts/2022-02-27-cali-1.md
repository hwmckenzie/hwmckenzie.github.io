This morning Chris and I boarded our first flight in over two years, taxied down the runway, and took off into what is hopefully the dawn of the post covid pandemic era. We are on our way to Yorba Linda, which is near Los Angeles, to visit Chris's Grandpo for five days. I'm looking forward to a change of scenery, or more particularly an exchange of snow for sand, windchill for ocean breezes, and chores for rest and relaxation!

To kick off our trip, last night we enjoyed a peaceful sleep at the Renaissance airport hotel. This provided a welcome delineation between our holiday and the chaos and effort associated with departing the house (which we did not leave tidy!), getting everyone to Edmonton (good work Chaser!), settling the dogs at the kennel (some more willingly than others!), and finally arriving at the airport (phew!).

We don't have any particular plans while we are in California, only to visit with Chris's Grandpo, enjoy the warm weather, and take in any sights or adventures that come our way. Stay tuned for updates.
