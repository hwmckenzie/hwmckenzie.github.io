After a few days enjoying California, Chris and I are back at the airport waiting for our flight home to winter. So far today we have enjoyed a last breakfast with Sandy, said goodbye to Grandpo, Mona and Cuddles, returned the car, received a negative covid test (phew!), and succeeded in clearing security. Quite a lot to accomplish by noon! With a bit of a wait before we board, it seemed like a good time to reflect on the beginning of our trip.

Our travel from Edmonton to Los Angeles was smooth sailing. It has been a long time since I've gone anywhere that did not require a connection, and after our direct flight I can soundly endorse this mode of travel! The US departures at the Edmonton airport was empty, in fact I was the first passenger of the day!

Our flight was only half full, so Chris and I enjoyed spreading out over three seats for the 3.5 hour flight. The only slight hitch occurred when I forgot my fleece on the plane. Westjet has a neat online system where you can register your lost item and they will update you when they find it. Unfortunately so far it seems they have had no luck in finding my fleece. Luckily there was no need for a fleece in California! The weather when we arrived was warm and sunny, which made waiting for our Lyft to get to our rental car very enjoyable. The rental car was one of the exciting parts of our trip. Chris rented our car through a peer-to-peer rental company called Turo. He specifically chose a Hyundai Kona, which is an electric vehicle, so we could try out the EV lifestyle. Once we had our car, we headed east on the 91 towards Yorba Linda. 

Chris's Grandpo Jack and his wife Mona live up in the hills outside of Yorba Linda with their dog Cuddles. To me, their house was a private villa. It was very quiet, enjoyed a great view of the surrounding hills, and had a large and beautiful yard. This outdoor oasis, made all the more enjoyable by the weather, included a pool, hot tub, and a citrus grove featuring lemons, oranges, mandarins, and limes. I could have spent the whole trip in their yard and been a happy girl!

For our arrival dinner we enjoyed hamburgers, salad, and chocolate cake, followed by a good night's sleep.
