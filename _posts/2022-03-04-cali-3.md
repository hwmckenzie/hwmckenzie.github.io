On our first morning (after enjoying a mandarin fresh off the tree!) we headed out in search of coffee. What we found was the LilyPopp Cafe, a great spot for coffee and bagels which could be enjoyed at tables outside. We became daily regulars at the LilyPopp during our stay, going so far as to visit twice in one day! 

Thanks to Cuddles, we continued our regular habit of daily dog walking, though the walks were a bit more sedate than what we experience with our pack. I can't say I minded. Our dogs might have a few things to learn from Cuddles!

While I had intentions of maintaining my regular yoga practice, I only practiced once. However, it was special as I was able to do it outside by the pool, which caused quite a commotion on Zoom when my teachers realized where I was! 

Grandpo Jack took us to Flappy Jack's for lunch, which I learned is the traditional and tasty spot to go for all occasions at his house. Thank goodness I squeezed in some yoga in advance! On our way home from the restaurant, we stopped to buy some fruit on the side of the road. I was delighted to find that not only were the strawberries local, they were actually growing in a small field directly behind the fruit stand! We noticed several of these small agricultural plots around the area, and the number of fruits and vegetables that grow in California got me thinking about my own summer garden plans. I'll have to be sure to adjust my farming aspirations to the Alberta climate though!

To round out the day, even though our car was still at 74%, Chris and I searched out a charging station at the mall to see how it worked. It was quite easy. Just like filling up at a gas station, except it took longer and cost less! Our car is not visible in the photo below as we had to use one of the non-Tesla chargers which were located at the back.
