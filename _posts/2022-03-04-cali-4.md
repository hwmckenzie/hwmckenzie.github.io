No trip to Los Angeles would be complete without a trip to the beach. On Tuesday we headed to Newport beach, which is about a 1 hour drive from Grandpo's house. The beach runs along the ocean side of a peninsula which forms Newport bay. We were able to park at the north end of the beach, right at Newport pier. I don't expect we would be so lucky to find this kind of parking during the high season, but with the early spring weather being "cool", the beach wasn't too busy!

After investigating the pier, we walked down the beach along a paved path which ran in front of a row of beachfront "cottages". These varied in design from rustic and quaint to modern and multi-storied. All had outdoor seating right along the path with patio doors opening to the inside, so we were able to look right into each as we passed. While they had quite the prime beach location, I think it would take some time to get used to all the passersby as the path was quite busy with people walking, biking, and rollerblading. We even saw a guy on a segway pulling a stereo that was playing tunes on a cart behind him! 

We eventually arrived at Balboa pier at the south end of the beach, a little hot and footsore. After sitting in the shade for a bit with a cool drink, we crossed over to the bay side and starting working our way back. This side was more sheltered and had a mix of tourist attractions, including restaurants and a small amusement park, and very fancy homes complete with boat parking out front!

We stopped at a restaurant for lunch, where we watched two small ferries crisscross the bay as they shuttled people and vehicles back and forth from Balbao island. We didn't visit the island ourselves, but it was clear even from a distance that it was very upscale! Chris said he'd heard that in Los Angeles there are the Haves, the Have Nots, and the Have Yachts!

After lunch we walked back to our starting point at Newport pier and took refuge from the sun under the pier for a few minutes before venturing down to stick our toes in the ocean. Despite the hot day, the water was still cold from the winter so there was no swimming! Satisfied with our day at the beach and only slightly sunburnt, we headed back to Grandpo's, with a quick stop to pick up some tuna steaks and salads for dinner in anticipation of Sandy's arrival.
