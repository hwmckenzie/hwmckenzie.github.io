With Sandy joining our party, we were on the hunt for something different and "fresh" that we could all do on our last day. After combing through some suggestions online, we decided to take a trip to the grocery store. But not just any grocery store, the local Amazon Fresh store!

Amazon Fresh touts itself as a "seamless grocery shopping experience". You can order groceries online for pick-up or delivery, or go shopping in the store for the traditional shopping cart and check-out experience... But, since we can enjoy all of those things at home, we were looking for their freshest experience, the Amazon Dash Cart combined with the Just Walk Out! Let me explain. The Dash Cart is a special shopping cart which uses a built in camera and scale to automatically keep track of what you put in your cart. The Just Walk Out allows you to literally just walk right out of the store with your groceries when you are done shopping... after connecting your Dash Cart to your Amazon account, and therefore your credit card of course!

While the store was cool-looking and the shopping process very cutting-edge, we were not entirely wowed by our Fresh experience. There were some initial challenges connecting our cart to Chris and Sandy's Amazon accounts, due to the fact they were Amazon.ca and not .com customers. So, Grampo Jack, being the only one with an American credit card, had to foot the bill for our outing. After some hard work by a dedicated Amazon employee, holders of multiple university degrees, and a final year computer science student, our cart was connected and we were shopping! The camera did work quite well at capturing what was added to the cart and was able to detect if you had put something back on the shelf. But we discovered that produce required a bit more work by the customer to enter amounts. We felt the selection was average and the prices were definitely above average. However, it was still a neat experience and not something I expect to see in Vegreville or Vermilion anytime soon!

That afternoon, Chris and I planned to stop at a pharmacy to get the required rapid covid test for our return to Canada. Having been able to easily get one at Superstore in Edmonton before we left, we did not foresee any difficulties. It turns out, we should have! None of the pharmacies we stopped at were doing rapid tests, only giving them out for home use. We did find a location offering rapid tests for travel purposes, but they had no appointments before our flight. Yikes! In the end we were able to get our tests done at the airport the morning of our flight, for an exorbitant price which we could hardly afford not to pay as it was the cost of getting home. Oh well, at least they came back negative!

To finish off our day, Grampo Jack took us for dinner at Woody's Diner. Very tasty food and we were excited because there was a charging station in the same parking lot, allowing us to recharge our rental EV while enjoying dinner!

The next morning, Chris and I headed back to the airport, hopped on our flight, and landed in a wintery night in Edmonton. I did miss my lost jacket at this point in the trip! After a good night's sleep at Marlene and Ron's, we picked up the dogs from the kennel and drove the final leg of our journey back to the property. As always, it was good to get home, but it was a great trip!
