<p>This is the blog of Chris and Hannah, for all things related to our property - which we call "The Property."
The goal is to have monthly posts sharing what we - and our small pack of dogs - have been up to. It is our hope
that this can both keep family and friends up-to-date, as well as serve as a reminder for ourselves about what
we've done. Stretching the name of our blog a bit, we also post updates from any traveling adventures.</p>

<p>"The Property" consists of ~36 acres of trees and grass (and one dugout), a 1.5 hour drive east of Edmonton.
We bought The Property in 2015 and built a house in 2016, which we've lived in ever since. Having been city
slickers all our lives, our ambitions for our place frequently run up against the reality of living in the
country. The results are many lessons learned and lots of material for our blog.</p>

<p>The couple of "Chris and Hannah" is made up of one perpetual student and one ambitous government employee.
Together, we tend to a small pack of dogs. When the opportunity arose to add a working dog to our pack,
long-held dreams of country living (as well as city bylaws) pushed us out of the city and into the country.
Here, we work from home, tend to chores, and generally try to live our best lives from our rural location.</p>
